<para id="fs-id1168329295259">As we saw previously, the range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus to the age of Earth, from the tiny sizes of subnuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than qualitative descriptions alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to express them. We shall find that even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds, a profound simplicity of nature appears: all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only seven base physical quantities.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168329075122">We define a <term>physical quantity</term> either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other measurements. For example, we might define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, such as using a meter stick and a stopwatch. Then, we could define <emphasis effect="italics">average speed</emphasis> by stating that it is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by time of travel.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168326851144">Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of <term>units</term>, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_01_02_NoUnits"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1168329031558">Two major systems of units are used in the world: <term>SI units</term> (for the French <emphasis effect="italics">Système International d’Unités</emphasis>), also known as the <emphasis effect="italics">metric system</emphasis>, and <term>English units</term> (also known as the <emphasis effect="italics">customary</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">imperial system</emphasis>). English units were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States. English units may also be referred to as the <emphasis effect="italics">foot–pound–second</emphasis> (fps) system, as opposed to the <emphasis effect="italics">centimeter–gram–second</emphasis> (cgs) system. You may also encounter the term <emphasis effect="italics">SAE units</emphasis>, named after the Society of Automotive Engineers. Products such as fasteners and automotive tools (for example, wrenches) that are measured in inches rather than metric units are referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">SAE fasteners</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">SAE wrenches</emphasis>.</para>

<title>SI Units: Base and Derived Units</title>
<para id="fs-id1168326756913">In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the <term>base quantities</term> for that system and their units are the system’s <term>base unit</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a <term>derived quantity</term> and each unit is called a <emphasis effect="bold">derived unit</emphasis>. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the <term class="no-emphasis">derived units</term> can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168329477724">Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units. <link target-id="fs-id1168326798535"/> lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168329125088">You are probably already familiar with some derived quantities that can be formed from the base quantities in <link target-id="fs-id1168326798535"/>. For example, the geometric concept of area is always calculated as the product of two lengths. Thus, area is a derived quantity that can be expressed in terms of SI base units using square meters <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">(</m:mo><m:mtext>m</m:mtext><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>m</m:mtext><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:msup><m:mtext>m</m:mtext><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup><m:mo stretchy="false">)</m:mo><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> Similarly, volume is a derived quantity that can be expressed in cubic meters <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">(</m:mo><m:msup><m:mtext>m</m:mtext><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:msup><m:mo stretchy="false">)</m:mo><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> Speed is length per time; so in terms of SI base units, we could measure it in meters per second (m/s). Volume mass density (or just density) is mass per volume, which is expressed in terms of SI base units such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m<sup>3</sup>). Angles can also be thought of as derived quantities because they can be defined as the ratio of the arc length subtended by two radii of a circle to the radius of the circle. This is how the radian is defined. Depending on your background and interests, you may be able to come up with other derived quantities, such as the mass flow rate (kg/s) or volume flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/s) of a fluid, electric charge <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mtext>A</m:mtext><m:mo>·</m:mo><m:mtext>s</m:mtext><m:mo>)</m:mo><m:mo>,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> mass flux density <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>[kg/</m:mtext><m:mo stretchy="false">(</m:mo><m:msup><m:mtext>m</m:mtext><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup><m:mo>·</m:mo><m:mtext>s)],</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> and so on. We will see many more examples throughout this text. For now, the point is that every physical quantity can be derived from the seven base quantities in <link target-id="fs-id1168326798535"/>, and the units of every physical quantity can be derived from the seven SI base units.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168329116133">For the most part, we use SI units in this text.

<title>Units of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram</title>
<para id="fs-id1168329400791">The initial chapters in this textbook are concerned with mechanics, fluids, and waves. In these subjects all pertinent physical quantities can be expressed in terms of the base units of length, mass, and time. Therefore, we now turn to a discussion of these three base units, leaving discussion of the others until they are needed later.</para>

<title>The second</title>
<para id="fs-id1168329467153">The SI unit for time, the <term>second</term> (abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in terms of a nonvarying or constant physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer as a result of the very gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations to occur (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_01_02_AtomClock"/>). Note that this may seem like more precision than you would ever need, but it isn’t—GPSs rely on the precision of atomic clocks to be able to give you turn-by-turn directions on the surface of Earth, far from the satellites broadcasting their location.</para>

<title>The meter</title>
<para id="fs-id1168329477884">The SI unit for length is the <term>meter</term> (abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum–iridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its current definition (in part for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_01_02_Meter"/>). This change came after knowing the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 m/s. The length of the meter will change if the speed of light is someday measured with greater accuracy.</para>

<title>The kilogram</title>
<para id="fs-id1168329079848">The SI unit for mass is the <term>kilogram</term> (abbreviated kg); From 1795–2018 it was defined to be the mass of a platinum–iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. However, this cylinder has lost roughly 50 micrograms since it was created. Because this is the standard, this has shifted how we defined a kilogram. Therefore, a new definition was adopted in May 2019 based on the Planck constant and other constants which will never change in value. We will study Planck’s constant in quantum mechanics, which is an area of physics that describes how the smallest pieces of the universe work. The kilogram is measured on a Kibble balance (see <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_01_02_Mass"/>). When a weight is placed on a Kibble balance, an electrical current is produced that is proportional to Planck’s constant. Since Planck’s constant is defined, the exact current measurements in the balance define the kilogram.</para><figure id="CNX_UPhysics_01_02_Mass"><media id="fs-id1168326753671" alt="A photograph of the U S national institute of Standards and technology’s watt balance.">

<para id="fs-id1168329156221">The only rule when using metric prefixes is that you cannot “double them up.” For example, if you have measurements in petameters (1 Pm = 10<sup>15</sup> m), it is not proper to talk about megagigameters, although <m:math><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mn>6</m:mn></m:msup><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mn>9</m:mn></m:msup><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>15</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> In practice, the only time this becomes a bit confusing is when discussing masses.

<para id="fs-id1168329011691">As we see in the next section, metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There are 100 cm in 1 m, 1000 m in 1 km, and so on.

<para id="fs-id1168326904719">Another advantage of metric systems is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by scaling it with an appropriate metric prefix. The prefix is chosen by the order of magnitude of physical quantities commonly found in the task at hand. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, whereas distances in kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent new units for particular applications. Instead, we rescale the units with which we are already familiar.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168329072606">
<title>Strategy</title>
Since we are not allowed to “double-up” prefixes, we first need to restate the mass in grams by replacing the prefix symbol k with a factor of 10<sup>3</sup> (see <link target-id="fs-id1168326843228"/>). Then, we should see which two prefixes in <link target-id="fs-id1168326843228"/> are closest to the resulting power of 10 when the number is written in scientific notation. We use whichever of these two prefixes gives us a number between one and 1000.</para>

<title>Solution</title>
Replacing the k in kilogram with a factor of 10<sup>3</sup>, we find that</para>

<para id="fs-id1168329170492">From <link target-id="fs-id1168326843228"/>, we see that 10<sup>16</sup> is between “peta-” (10<sup>15</sup>) and “exa-” (10<sup>18</sup>).

<title>Significance</title>
It is easy to make silly arithmetic errors when switching from one prefix to another, so it is always a good idea to check that our final answer matches the number we started with. An easy way to do this is to put both numbers in scientific notation and count powers of 10, including the ones hidden in prefixes. If we did not make a mistake, the powers of 10 should match up. In this problem, we started with <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>1.93</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>13</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup><m:mtext>kg,</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> so we have 13 + 3 = 16 powers of 10. Our final answer in scientific notation is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>1.93</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mn>1</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> Pg, so we have 1 + 15 = 16 powers of 10. So, everything checks out.</para>

<item>Systems of units are built up from a small number of base units, which are defined by accurate and precise measurements of conventionally chosen base quantities. Other units are then derived as algebraic combinations of the base units.</item>
<item>Two commonly used systems of units are English units and SI units. All scientists and most of the other people in the world use SI, whereas nonscientists in the United States still tend to use English units.</item>
<item>The SI base units of length, mass, and time are the meter (m), kilogram (kg), and second (s), respectively.</item>
<item>SI units are a metric system of units, meaning values can be calculated by factors of 10. Metric prefixes may be used with metric units to scale the base units to sizes appropriate for almost any application.</item>
