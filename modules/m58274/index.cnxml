The digital scale has mostly replaced the double-pan balance in physics labs because it gives more accurate and precise measurements. But what exactly do we mean by <emphasis effect="italics">accurate</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">precise</emphasis>? Aren’t they the same thing? In this section we examine in detail the process of making and reporting a measurement.</para>

<caption>(a) A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The “known masses” are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 g, 10 g, and 100 g. (b) Many mechanical balances, such as double-pan balances, have been replaced by digital scales, which can typically measure the mass of an object more precisely. A mechanical balance may read only the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, but many digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram.

<title>Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327922756">Science is based on observation and experiment—that is, on measurements. <emphasis effect="bold">Accuracy</emphasis> is how close a measurement is to the accepted reference value for that measurement. For example, let’s say we want to measure the length of standard printer paper. The packaging in which we purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 in. long. We then measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the reference value of 11.0 in. In contrast, if we had obtained a measurement of 12 in., our measurement would not be very accurate. Notice that the concept of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">accuracy</term> requires that an accepted reference value be given.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168327967767">The <term id="term-00002">precision</term> of measurements refers to how close the agreement is between repeated independent measurements (which are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements. The precision of the measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of the measurements is to determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In this case, the lowest value was 10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 in. These measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in value. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 in., 11.1 in., and 11.9 in., then the measurements would not be very precise because there would be significant variation from one measurement to another. Notice that the concept of precision depends only on the actual measurements acquired and does not depend on an accepted reference value.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328285619">The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let’s consider an example of a GPS attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target and think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_01_06_Target"/>(a), we see the GPS measurements are spread out far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low-precision, high-accuracy measuring system. However, in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_01_06_Target"/>(b), the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high-precision, low-accuracy measuring system.</para>

<title>Accuracy, Precision, Uncertainty, and Discrepancy</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327908843">The precision of a measuring system is related to the <term id="term-00003">uncertainty</term> in the measurements whereas the accuracy is related to the <term id="term-00004">discrepancy</term> from the accepted reference value. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from one another. There are many different methods of calculating uncertainty, each of which is appropriate to different situations. Some examples include taking the range (that is, the largest minus the smallest) or finding the standard deviation of the measurements. Discrepancy (or “measurement error”) is the difference between the measured value and a given standard or expected value. If the measurements are not very precise, then the uncertainty of the values is high. If the measurements are not very accurate, then the discrepancy of the values is high.</para><para id="fs-id1168327854645">Recall our example of measuring paper length; we obtained measurements of 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in., and the accepted value was 11.0 in. We might average the three measurements to say our best guess is 11.1 in.; in this case, our discrepancy is 11.1 – 11.0 = 0.1 in., which provides a quantitative measure of accuracy. We might calculate the uncertainty in our best guess by using half of the range of our measured values: 0.15 in. Then we would say the length of the paper is 11.1 in. plus or minus 0.15 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>, is often denoted as <emphasis effect="italics">δA</emphasis> (read “delta <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>”), so the measurement result would be recorded as <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis> ± <emphasis effect="italics">δA</emphasis>. Returning to our paper example, the measured length of the paper could be expressed as 11.1 ± 0.15 in. Since the discrepancy of 0.1 in. is less than the uncertainty of 0.15 in., we might say the measured value agrees with the accepted reference value to within experimental uncertainty.</para><para id="fs-id1168327948810">Some factors that contribute to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:</para>
<list id="fs-id1168328196584" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Limitations of the measuring device</item>
<item>The skill of the person taking the measurement</item>
<item>Irregularities in the object being measured</item>
<item>Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1168327924918">In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the smallest division on the ruler is 1/16 in., the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, the ruler is worn down on one end, or one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other. At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be calculated to quantify its precision. If a reference value is known, it makes sense to calculate the discrepancy as well to quantify its accuracy.</para>
<section id="fs-id1168327944324">
<title>Percent uncertainty</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327991650">Another method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value.

<title>Uncertainties in calculations</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327869120">Uncertainty exists in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the <term id="term-00006">method of adding percents</term> can be used for multiplication or division. This method states <emphasis effect="italics">the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation</emphasis>. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2% and 1%, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m<sup>2</sup> and has an uncertainty of 3%.

<title>Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327960157">An important factor in the precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to the nearest millimeter whereas a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 mm. The caliper is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise the measurements.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328065844">When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we measured initially with our measuring tool. For example, if we use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, we may measure it to be 36.7 cm. We can’t express this value as 36.71 cm because our measuring tool is not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36.6 cm and 36.7 cm, and he or she must estimate the value of the last digit. Using the method of <term id="term-00007">significant figures</term>, the rule is that <emphasis effect="italics">the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty</emphasis>. To determine the number of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right. For example, the measured value 36.7 cm has three digits, or three significant figures. Significant figures indicate the precision of the measuring tool used to measure a value.</para>

<title>Zeros</title>
<para id="fs-id1168325631408">Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures.

The zeros in 10.053 are not placeholders; they are significant. This number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers.
