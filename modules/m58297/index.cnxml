<para id="fs-id1165039275238">Newton’s second law is closely related to his first law. It mathematically gives the cause-and-effect relationship between force and changes in motion. Newton’s second law is quantitative and is used extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force. Before we can write down Newton’s second law as a simple equation that gives the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to sharpen some ideas we mentioned earlier.</para>
<section id="fs-id1165038986731">
<title>Force and Acceleration</title>
<para id="fs-id1165039092833">First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that there is acceleration. Newton’s first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion; thus, we see that a <emphasis effect="italics">net external force causes nonzero acceleration</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039083134">We defined external force in <link document="m58295">Forces</link> as force acting on an object or system that originates outside of the object or system. Let’s consider this concept further. An intuitive notion of <emphasis effect="italics">external</emphasis> is correct—it is outside the system of interest. For example, in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_03_ExtForce"/>(a), the system of interest is the car plus the person within it. The two forces exerted by the two students are external forces. In contrast, an internal force acts between elements of the system. Thus, the force the person in the car exerts to hang on to the steering wheel is an internal force between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect the motion of a system, according to Newton’s first law. (The internal forces cancel each other out, as explained in the next section.) Therefore, we must define the boundaries of the system before we can determine which forces are external. Sometimes, the system is obvious, whereas at other times, identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The concept of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is the correct application of Newton’s laws. This concept is revisited many times in the study of physics.</para>

Figure b puts all the forces of figure a together and shows a net force F net. These forces are also shown in a free body diagram. Figure c shows the car being towed by a tow-truck.

<para id="fs-id1165039092504">From this example, you can see that different forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_03_ExtForce"/>(a), the two students push a car with a driver in it. Arrows representing all external forces are shown. The system of interest is the car and its driver. The weight <m:math><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>w</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:math> of the system and the support of the ground <m:math><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>N</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:math> are also shown for completeness and are assumed to cancel (because there was no vertical motion and no imbalance of forces in the vertical direction to create a change in motion).

(We discuss friction in more detail in the next chapter.) In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_03_ExtForce"/>(b), all external forces acting on the system add together to produce the net force <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle><m:mrow><m:mtext>net</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> The free-body diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The dot represents the center of mass of the system. Each force vector extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right, the vectors are shown collinearly. Finally, in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_03_ExtForce"/>(c), a larger net external force produces a larger acceleration <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">(</m:mo><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:msup><m:mi>a</m:mi><m:mo>′</m:mo></m:msup><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle><m:mo>&gt;</m:mo><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>a</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle><m:mo stretchy="false">)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> when the tow truck pulls the car.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039304642">It seems reasonable that acceleration would be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified experimentally and is illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_03_ExtForce"/>. To obtain an equation for Newton’s second law, we first write the relationship of acceleration <m:math><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>a</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:math> and net external force <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle><m:mrow><m:mtext>net</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> as the proportionality</para>

<para id="fs-id1165039109910">where the symbol <m:math><m:mo>∝</m:mo></m:math> means “proportional to.” (Recall from <link document="m58295">Forces</link> that the net external force is the vector sum of all external forces and is sometimes indicated as <m:math><m:mrow><m:mstyle displaystyle="true"><m:mo>∑</m:mo><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:mstyle><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math>) This proportionality shows what we have said in words—acceleration is directly proportional to net external force. Once the system of interest is chosen, identify the external forces and ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification to disregard the numerous internal forces acting between objects within the system, such as muscular forces within the students’ bodies, let alone the myriad forces between the atoms in the objects. Still, this simplification helps us solve some complex problems.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039188181">It also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. As illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_03_Basketball"/>, the same net external force applied to a basketball produces a much smaller acceleration when it is applied to an SUV. The proportionality is written as</para>

<para id="fs-id1165038998097"><title>Significance</title>
The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the net force, which is parallel to the ground. This is a result of the vector relationship expressed in Newton’s second law, that is, the vector representing net force is the scalar multiple of the acceleration vector. There is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower moved forward), and the vertical forces must cancel because no acceleration occurs in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long, because the person’s top speed would soon be reached.</para>

For a car or any other object to move, it must be accelerated from rest to the desired speed; this requires that the friction force be greater than the drag force. Once the car is moving at constant velocity, the net force must be zero; otherwise, the car will accelerate (gain speed). To solve problems involving Newton’s laws, we must understand whether to apply Newton’s first law (where <m:math><m:mrow><m:mstyle displaystyle="true"><m:mo>∑</m:mo><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:mstyle><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mn>0</m:mn><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:mrow></m:math>) or Newton’s second law (where <m:math><m:mrow><m:mstyle displaystyle="true"><m:mo>∑</m:mo><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle></m:mstyle></m:mrow></m:math> is not zero).

Although forces are acting both vertically and horizontally, we assume the vertical forces cancel because there is no vertical acceleration.

Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start with Newton’s second law and look for ways to find the thrust of the engines.

We must remember that Newton’s second law is a vector equation. In (a), we are multiplying a vector by a scalar to determine the net force in vector form. While the vector form gives a compact representation of the force vector, it does not tell us how “big” it is, or where it goes, in intuitive terms.

<item>Newton’s second law of motion says that the net external force on an object with a certain mass is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the acceleration of the object.</item>
<item>Newton’s second law can also describe net force as the instantaneous rate of change of momentum. Thus, a net external force causes nonzero acceleration.</item>

<para id="fs-id1165039487886">Astronauts in orbit are apparently weightless. This means that a clever method of measuring the mass of astronauts is needed to monitor their mass gains or losses, and adjust their diet. One way to do this is to exert a known force on an astronaut and measure the acceleration produced. Suppose a net external force of 50.0 N is exerted, and an astronaut’s acceleration is measured to be <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>0.893</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mtext>m/s</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math>.
