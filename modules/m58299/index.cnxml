<para id="fs-id1165038232475">Newton’s third law represents a certain symmetry in nature: Forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as “action-reaction,” where the force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton’s third law has practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which forces are external to a system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165036779724">We can readily see Newton’s third law at work by taking a look at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off the side of a pool (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_05_Swimmer"/>). She pushes against the wall of the pool with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and opposite force on the swimmer. You might think that two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not <emphasis effect="italics">because they act on different systems</emphasis>. In this case, there are two systems that we could investigate: the swimmer and the wall. If we select the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>wall on feet</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> is an external force on this system and affects its motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of this force. In contrast, the force <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>feet on wall</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> acts on the wall, not on our system of interest. Thus, <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>feet on wall</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> does not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>wall on feet</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> The swimmer pushes in the direction opposite that in which she wishes to move. The reaction to her push is thus in the desired direction. In a free-body diagram, such as the one shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_05_Swimmer"/>, we never include both forces of an action-reaction pair; in this case, we only use <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>wall on feet</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>, not <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>feet on wall</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>.</para>

<item>As a professor paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force forward on the professor that causes him to accelerate forward.</item>
<item>A car accelerates forward because the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels, in reaction to the drive wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw the rocks backward.</item>
<item>Rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at high velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber; therefore, the gas exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket. This reaction force, which pushes a body forward in response to a backward force, is called <term>thrust</term>. It is a common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum, where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases.</item>

<para id="fs-id1165036894942"><title>Significance</title>
None of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the professor’s hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force because they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is that forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the professor on the cart results in an equal and opposite force back on the professor. In this case, both forces act on the same system and therefore cancel. Thus, internal forces (between components of a system) cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving this problem.</para>

This force is significantly less than the 150-N force the professor exerted backward on the floor. Not all of that 150-N force is transmitted to the cart; some of it accelerates the professor. The choice of a system is an important analytical step both in solving problems and in thoroughly understanding the physics of the situation (which are not necessarily the same things).</para>
