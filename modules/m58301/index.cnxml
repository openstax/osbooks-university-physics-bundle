<para id="fs-id1165039077991">The first step in describing and analyzing most phenomena in physics involves the careful drawing of a free-body diagram. Free-body diagrams have been used in examples throughout this chapter. Remember that a free-body diagram must only include the external forces acting on the body of interest. Once we have drawn an accurate free-body diagram, we can apply Newton’s first law if the body is in equilibrium (balanced forces; that is, <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>net</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math>) or Newton’s second law if the body is accelerating (unbalanced force; that is, <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>net</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>≠</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039401582">In <link document="m58295">Forces</link>, we gave a brief problem-solving strategy to help you understand free-body diagrams. Here, we add some details to the strategy that will help you in constructing these diagrams.</para>

<title>Constructing Free-Body Diagrams</title>
<para id="fs-id1165039446536">Observe the following rules when constructing a free-body diagram:</para>
<list id="fs-id1165039107283" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>Draw the object under consideration; it does not have to be artistic. At first, you may want to draw a circle around the object of interest to be sure you focus on labeling the forces acting on the object. If you are treating the object as a particle (no size or shape and no rotation), represent the object as a point. We often place this point at the origin of an <emphasis effect="italics">xy</emphasis>-coordinate system.</item>
<item>Include all forces that act on the object, representing these forces as vectors. Consider the types of forces described in <link document="m58300">Common Forces</link>—normal force, friction, tension, and spring force—as well as weight and applied force. Do not include the net force on the object. With the exception of gravity, all of the forces we have discussed require direct contact with the object. However, forces that the object exerts on its environment must not be included. We never include both forces of an action-reaction pair.</item>
<item>Convert the free-body diagram into a more detailed diagram showing the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-components of a given force (this is often helpful when solving a problem using Newton’s first or second law). In this case, place a squiggly line through the original vector to show that it is no longer in play—it has been replaced by its <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-components.</item>
<item>If there are two or more objects, or bodies, in the problem, draw a separate free-body diagram for each object.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1165038980244"><emphasis effect="italics">Note:</emphasis> If there is acceleration, we do not directly include it in the free-body diagram; however, it may help to indicate acceleration outside the free-body diagram. You can label it in a different color to indicate that it is separate from the free-body diagram.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165039073989"><title>Strategy</title>
We follow the four steps listed in the problem-solving strategy.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039304581"><title>Solution</title>
We start by creating a diagram for the first object of interest. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_07_BlockAB"/>(a), object A is isolated (circled) and represented by a dot.</para>
<figure id="CNX_UPhysics_05_07_BlockAB">

A free body diagram shows T pointing right and up, parallel to the plane, N subscript BA pointing left and up, perpendicular to the plane, f subscript BA pointing left and down, parallel to the plane and w subscript A pointing vertically down. W subscript A is weight of block A, T is tension, N subscript BA is normal force exerted by B on A, f subscript BA is friction force exerted by B on A. Figure b shows the objects on the slope in the same manner. A free body diagram has f subscript B and f subscript AB pointing right and up, parallel to the slope, N subscript B pointing left and up perpendicular to the slope, w subscript B pointing vertically down and N subscript AB pointing down and right, perpendicular to the slope. W subscript B is weight of block B, N subscript AB is normal force exerted by A on B, N subscript B is normal force exerted by the incline plane on B. f subscript AB is friction force exerted by A on B. f subscript B is friction force exerted by the incline plane on B.">

<caption>(a) The free-body diagram for isolated object A. (b) The free-body diagram for isolated object B. Comparing the two drawings, we see that friction acts in the opposite direction in the two figures. Because object A experiences a force that tends to pull it to the right, friction must act to the left. Because object B experiences a component of its weight that pulls it to the left, down the incline, the friction force must oppose it and act up the ramp. Friction always acts opposite the intended direction of motion.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1165039003890">We now include any force that acts on the body. Here, no applied force is present. The weight of the object acts as a force pointing vertically downward, and the presence of the cord indicates a force of tension pointing away from the object. Object A has one interface and hence experiences a normal force, directed away from the interface. The source of this force is object B, and this normal force is labeled accordingly. Since object B has a tendency to slide down, object A has a tendency to slide up with respect to the interface, so the friction <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>BA</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> is directed downward parallel to the inclined plane.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039292034">As noted in step 4 of the problem-solving strategy, we then construct the free-body diagram in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_05_07_BlockAB"/>(b) using the same approach. Object B experiences two normal forces and two friction forces due to the presence of two contact surfaces. The interface with the inclined plane exerts external forces of <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>N</m:mi><m:mtext>B</m:mtext></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> and <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mtext>B</m:mtext></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>, and the interface with object B exerts the normal force <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>N</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>AB</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> and friction <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>AB</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>; <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>N</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>AB</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> is directed away from object B, and <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>AB</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> is opposing the tendency of the relative motion of object B with respect to object A.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039101304"><title>Significance</title>
The object under consideration in each part of this problem was circled in gray. When you are first learning how to draw free-body diagrams, you will find it helpful to circle the object before deciding what forces are acting on that particular object. This focuses your attention, preventing you from considering forces that are not acting on the body.</para>
