<para id="fs-id1165038188345">Let’s apply this problem-solving strategy to the challenge of lifting a grand piano into a second-story apartment. Once we have determined that Newton’s laws of motion are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. Such a sketch is shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_PianoHoist"/>(a). Then, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_PianoHoist"/>(b), we can represent all forces with arrows. Whenever sufficient information exists, it is best to label these arrows carefully and make the length and direction of each correspond to the represented force.</para>

Figure a is a sketch showing the piano hanging from a crane and part way through a window. Figure b identifies the forces. It shows the same sketch with the addition of the forces, represented as labeled vector arrows. Vector T points up, vector F sub T points down, vector w points down. Figure c defines the system of interest. The sketch is  shown again with the piano circled and identified as the system of interest. Only vectors T up and w down are included in this diagram. The downward force F sub T is not a force on the system of interest since it is exerted on the outside world. It must be omitted from the free body diagram. The free body diagram is shown as well. It consists of a dot, representing the system of interest, and the vectors T pointing up and w pointing down, with their tails at the dot. Figure d shows the addition of the forces. Vectors T and w are shown. We are told that these forces must be equal and opposite since the net external force is zero. Thus T is equal to minus w.">

<para id="fs-id1165037264521">As with most problems, we next need to identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be inferred from the problem as stated, that is, make a list of knowns and unknowns. It is particularly crucial to identify the system of interest, since Newton’s second law involves only external forces. We can then determine which forces are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ Newton’s second law. (See <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_PianoHoist"/>(c).) Newton’s third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between components of a system (internal) or between the system and something outside (external). As illustrated in <link document="m58294">Newton’s Laws of Motion</link>, the system of interest depends on the question we need to answer. Only forces are shown in free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn several free-body diagrams in previous worked examples. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_PianoHoist"/>(c) shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a free-body diagram.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165038229922">Once a free-body diagram is drawn, we apply Newton’s second law. This is done in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_PianoHoist"/>(d) for a particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensional—that is, if all forces are parallel—then the forces can be handled algebraically. If the problem is two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of one-dimensional problems. We do this by projecting the force vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples, the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this is known. Generally, just write Newton’s second law in components along the different directions. Then, you have the following equations:</para>
<equation id="fs-id1165038355621" class="unnumbered"><label/><m:math><m:mrow><m:mstyle displaystyle="true"><m:mo>∑</m:mo><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>m</m:mi><m:msub><m:mi>a</m:mi><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>,</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.5em"/><m:mstyle displaystyle="true"><m:mo>∑</m:mo><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mi>y</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>m</m:mi><m:msub><m:mi>a</m:mi><m:mi>y</m:mi></m:msub></m:mrow></m:mstyle></m:mrow></m:mstyle><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></equation>
<para id="fs-id1165037222243">(If, for example, the system is accelerating horizontally, then you can then set <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>a</m:mi><m:mi>y</m:mi></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math>) We need this information to determine unknown forces acting on a system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165038201982">As always, we must check the solution. In some cases, it is easy to tell whether the solution is reasonable. For example, it is reasonable to find that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving; with experience, it becomes progressively easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check a solution is to check the units. If we are solving for force and end up with units of millimeters per second, then we have made a mistake.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165038396151">There are many interesting applications of Newton’s laws of motion, a few more of which are presented in this section. These serve also to illustrate some further subtleties of physics and to help build problem-solving skills. We look first at problems involving particle equilibrium, which make use of Newton’s first law, and then consider particle acceleration, which involves Newton’s second law.</para>

<title>Particle Equilibrium</title>
<para id="fs-id1165038270451">Recall that a particle in equilibrium is one for which the external forces are balanced. Static equilibrium involves objects at rest, and dynamic equilibrium involves objects in motion without acceleration, but it is important to remember that these conditions are relative. For example, an object may be at rest when viewed from our frame of reference, but the same object would appear to be in motion when viewed by someone moving at a constant velocity. We now make use of the knowledge attained in <link document="m58294">Newton’s Laws of Motion</link>, regarding the different types of forces and the use of free-body diagrams, to solve additional problems in <term class="no-emphasis">particle equilibrium</term>.</para>

Tension T sub two is shown by a vector arrow pointing downward from the top of the right-hand pole along the right-hand wire, and an equal but opposite tension T sub two is shown by the arrow pointing up along the right-hand wire, which makes a forty-five degree angle with the horizontal.

The system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram is shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_StopLight"/>(c). The three forces involved are not parallel, and so they must be projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector projections on it are shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_StopLight"/>(d).

Acceleration of the barge, a, is shown by a vector arrow directed fifty-three point one degree angle above the x axis.

The resultant is the hypotenuse of this triangle, vector F sub app, making a fifty-three point one degree angle from the base vector F sub 1.

The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large barge.

<para id="fs-id1165037973823">Thus, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his 735-N (165-lb.) weight. This means that the scale is pushing up on the person with a force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him upward. Clearly, the greater the acceleration of the elevator, the greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_Scale"/>(b), the scale reading is 735 N, which equals the person’s weight. This is the case whenever the elevator has a constant velocity—moving up, moving down, or stationary.</para>

We draw a free-body diagram for each mass separately, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_01_Table"/>. Then we analyze each one to find the required unknowns. The forces on block 1 are the gravitational force, the contact force of the surface, and the tension in the string. Block 2 is subjected to the gravitational force and the string tension.

Newton’s laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion.

The following worked example illustrates how the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter, as well as strategies presented in other chapters, is applied to an integrated concept problem.</para>

Notice the need to apply calculus since the force is not constant, which also means that acceleration is not constant. To make matters worse, the force depends on <emphasis effect="italics">v</emphasis> (not <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>), and so we must use the trick explained prior to the example. The answer for the height indicates a lower elevation if there were air resistance. We will deal with the effects of air resistance and other drag forces in greater detail in <link document="m58306">Drag Force and Terminal Speed</link>.</para>

<list id="fs-id1165036852024" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Newton’s laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve motion problems.</item>
<item>Some problems contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object accelerates so that you can determine whether <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>net</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>m</m:mi><m:mi>a</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> or <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>net</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></item>
<item>The normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating vertically, the normal force is less than or greater than the weight of the object. Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force is always less than the full weight of the object.</item>
<item>Some problems contain several physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apply concepts from kinematics and dynamics to solve these problems.</item>
