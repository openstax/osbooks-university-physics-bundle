<para id="fs-id1165036972366">When a body is in motion, it has resistance because the body interacts with its surroundings. This resistance is a force of friction. Friction opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move, a concept that becomes obvious if you try to walk on ice. Friction is a common yet complex force, and its behavior still not completely understood. Still, it is possible to understand the circumstances in which it behaves.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165037201472">There are several forms of friction. One of the simpler characteristics of sliding friction is that it is parallel to the contact surfaces between systems and is always in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. When objects are stationary, static friction can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between two objects.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165038048633">Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor—you might push very hard on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. If you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Now static friction gives way to kinetic friction. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic frictional force is less than the static frictional force. If you add mass to the crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you might expect).</para>
<para id="fs-id1165037223615"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_02_Friction"/> is a crude pictorial representation of how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. Thus, when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect of surface physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.</para>

<media id="fs-id1165036754917" alt="The figure shows a crate on a flat surface. A black arrow points toward the right, away from the crate, and is labeled as the direction of motion or attempted motion. A red arrow pointing toward the left is located near the bottom left corner of the crate, at the interface between that corner and the supporting surface and is labeled as f. A magnified view of a bottom corner of the crate and the supporting surface shows that the roughness in the two surfaces leads to small gaps between them. There is direct contact only at a few points.">

<caption>Frictional forces, such as <m:math><m:mrow><m:mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">→</m:mo></m:mover></m:mstyle><m:mo>,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view. For the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks of the top surface can skip along the bottom surface. Thus, a force is required just to set the object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also requiring a force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects, so that even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. (In fact, perfectly smooth, clean surfaces of similar materials would adhere, forming a bond called a “cold weld.”)</caption>

A joint is formed by the ends of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost-glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that reduces friction and wear.

This example illustrates how we consider friction in a dynamics problem. Notice that static friction has a value that matches the applied force, until we reach the maximum value of static friction. Also, no motion can occur until the applied force equals the force of static friction, but the force of kinetic friction will then become smaller.</para>

<title>Friction and the Inclined Plane</title>
<para id="fs-id1165038302166">One situation where friction plays an obvious role is that of an object on a slope. It might be a crate being pushed up a ramp to a loading dock or a skateboarder coasting down a mountain, but the basic physics is the same. We usually generalize the sloping surface and call it an <term class="no-emphasis">inclined plane</term> but then pretend that the surface is flat. Let’s look at an example of analyzing motion on an inclined plane with friction.</para>

The magnitude of kinetic friction is given as 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force <m:math><m:mi>N</m:mi></m:math> by <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mtext>k</m:mtext></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:msub><m:mi>μ</m:mi><m:mtext>k</m:mtext></m:msub><m:mi>N</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math>; thus, we can find the coefficient of kinetic friction if we can find the normal force on the skier. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force should equal the component of the skier’s weight perpendicular to the slope. (See <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_02_Skislope2"/>, which repeats a figure from the chapter on Newton’s laws of motion.)</para>

An x y coordinate system is shown, tilted so that the positive x direction is parallel to the slop, pointing up the slope, and the positive y direction is out of the slope, perpendicular to it. The weight of the skier, labeled w, is represented by a red arrow pointing vertically downward. This weight is divided into two components, w sub y is perpendicular to the slope pointing in the minus y direction, and w sub x is parallel to the slope, pointing in the minus x direction. The normal force, labeled N, is also perpendicular to the slope, equal in magnitude but pointing out, opposite in direction to w sub y. The friction, f, is represented by a red arrow pointing upslope. In addition, the figure shows a free body diagram that shows the relative magnitudes and directions of f, N, w, and the components w sub x and w sub y of w.

<title>Atomic-Scale Explanations of Friction</title>
<para id="fs-id1165037975147">The simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only explain some of the simpler aspects of friction—they also hold the potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently being converted (unnecessarily) into heat.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165038042369"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_02_Force"/> illustrates one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by microscopic (small-scale) research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but not to the amount of area in contact, a somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total area because only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the actual contact area increases, and we find that the friction is proportional to this area.</para>
<figure id="CNX_UPhysics_06_02_Force">
<media id="fs-id1165038024613" alt="This figure has two parts, each of which shows two rough parallel surfaces in close proximity to each other. Because the surfaces are irregular, the two surfaces contact each other only at certain points, leaving gaps in between. In the first part, the normal force is small, so that the surfaces are farther apart and area of contact between the two surfaces is much smaller than their total area. In the second part, the normal force is large, so that the two surfaces are very close to each other and area of contact between the two surfaces has increased.">

<caption>Two rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual contact than their total area. When the normal force is larger as a result of a larger applied force, the area of actual contact increases, as does friction.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1165037157342">However, the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed? Essentially, atoms are linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and cause atomic lattices to vibrate—essentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material. The sound waves diminish with distance, and their energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear can also occur between atoms and molecules on the surfaces. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_02_Probe"/> shows how the tip of a probe drawn across another material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured and is found to be related to <term class="no-emphasis">shear stress</term>, which is discussed in <link document="m58339">Static Equilibrium and Elasticity</link>. The variation in shear stress is remarkable (more than a factor of <m:math><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>12</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math>) and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a fundamental understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient times—friction.</para>

<media id="fs-id1165038398408" alt="This figure shows a molecular model of a probe that is dragged over the surface of a substrate. The substrate is represented by a rectangular grid of small spheres, each sphere representing an atom. The probe, made up of a different grid of small spheres, is in the form of an inverted pyramid with a flattened peak and horizontal layers of atoms. The pyramid is somewhat distorted because of friction. The atomic and molecular interactions occur at the interface between the probe and the substrate. The friction, f, is parallel to the surface and in the opposite direction of the motion of the probe. ">
