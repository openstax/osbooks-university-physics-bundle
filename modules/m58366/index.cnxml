<para id="fs-id1167134821372">Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it with the dampers off its strings (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_15_06_PianoStr"/>). It will sing the same note back at you—the strings, having the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate, and oscillate most easily at their natural frequency. In this section, we briefly explore applying a <term class="no-emphasis">periodic driving force</term> acting on a simple harmonic oscillator. The driving force puts energy into the system at a certain frequency, not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system. Recall that the natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force.</para>

Imagine the finger in the figure is your finger. At first, you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball follows along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball responds by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called <term>resonance</term>. A system being driven at its natural frequency is said to <emphasis effect="italics">resonate</emphasis>. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller until the oscillations nearly disappear, and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.</para>

In the second figure the finger moves up and down with frequency f sub zero and the movement of the ball is much larger than in the first.

Recall that the angular frequency, and therefore the frequency, of the motor can be adjusted. Looking at the denominator of the equation for the amplitude, when the driving frequency is much smaller, or much larger, than the natural frequency, the square of the difference of the two angular frequencies <m:math><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mi>ω</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup><m:mo>−</m:mo><m:msubsup><m:mi>ω</m:mi><m:mn>0</m:mn><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msubsup></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> is positive and large, making the denominator large, and the result is a small amplitude for the oscillations of the mass. As the frequency of the driving force approaches the natural frequency of the system, the denominator becomes small and the amplitude of the oscillations becomes large. The maximum amplitude results when the frequency of the driving force equals the natural frequency of the system <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>A</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>max</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>b</m:mi><m:mi>ω</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>.</para><para id="fs-id1167131237840"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_15_07_ForcDmpAmp"/> shows a graph of the amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator as a function of the frequency of the periodic force driving it. Each of the three curves on the graph represents a different amount of damping. All three curves peak at the point where the frequency of the driving force equals the natural frequency of the harmonic oscillator. The highest peak, or greatest response, is for the least amount of damping, because less energy is removed by the damping force. Note that since the amplitude grows as the damping decreases, taking this to the limit where there is no damping <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mi>b</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>, the amplitude becomes infinite.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167131629451">Note that a small-amplitude driving force can produce a large-amplitude response. This phenomenon is known as resonance. A common example of resonance is a parent pushing a small child on a swing. When the child wants to go higher, the parent does not move back and then, getting a running start, slam into the child, applying a great force in a short interval. Instead, the parent applies small pushes to the child at just the right frequency, and the amplitude of the child’s swings increases.</para>

The curves represent the same oscillator with the same natural frequency but with different amounts of damping. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency equals the natural frequency, and the greatest response is for the least amount of damping. The narrowest response is also for the least damping.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167131421041">It is interesting to note that the widths of the resonance curves shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_15_07_ForcDmpAmp"/> depend on damping: the less the damping, the narrower the resonance. The consequence is that if you want a driven oscillator to resonate at a very specific frequency, you need as little damping as possible. For instance, a radio has a circuit that is used to choose a particular radio station. In this case, the forced damped oscillator consists of a resistor, capacitor, and inductor, which will be discussed later in this course. The circuit is “tuned” to pick a particular radio station. Here it is desirable to have the resonance curve be very narrow, to pick out the exact frequency of the radio station chosen. The narrowness of the graph, and the ability to pick out a certain frequency, is known as the quality of the system. The quality is defined as the spread of the angular frequency, or equivalently, the spread in the frequency, at half the maximum amplitude, divided by the natural frequency <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mi>Q</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>ω</m:mi><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>ω</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> as shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_15_07_ResQuality"/>.

<para id="fs-id1167131150474">These features of driven harmonic oscillators apply to a huge variety of systems. For instance, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical diagnostic tool in which atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen nuclei or protons) are made to resonate by incoming radio waves (on the order of 100 MHz). In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_15_07_TacomaNarr"/> shows the London Millennium Footbridge that allows pedestrians to cross the River Thames in London.

<solution id="fs-id1167134870890">
<para id="fs-id1167130035194">All harmonic motion is damped harmonic motion, but the damping may be negligible. This is due to friction and drag forces. It is easy to come up with five examples of damped motion: (1) A mass oscillating on a hanging on a spring (it eventually comes to rest). (2) Shock absorbers in a car (thankfully they also come to rest). (3) A pendulum is a grandfather clock (weights are added to add energy to the oscillations). (4) A child on a swing (eventually comes to rest unless energy is added by pushing the child). (5) A marble rolling in a bowl (eventually comes to rest). As for the undamped motion, even a mass on a spring in a vacuum will eventually come to rest due to internal forces in the spring. Damping may be negligible, but cannot be eliminated.</para>
