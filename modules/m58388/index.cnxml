<para id="fs-id1170903888376"><term class="no-emphasis">Phase transitions</term> play an important theoretical and practical role in the study of heat flow. In <term class="no-emphasis">melting</term> (or “fusion”), a solid turns into a liquid; the opposite process is <term class="no-emphasis">freezing</term>. In <term class="no-emphasis">evaporation</term>, a liquid turns into a gas; the opposite process is <term class="no-emphasis">condensation</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170904166330">A substance melts or freezes at a temperature called its melting point, and boils (evaporates rapidly) or condenses at its boiling point. These temperatures depend on pressure. High pressure favors the denser form, so typically, high pressure raises the melting point and boiling point, and low pressure lowers them. For example, the boiling point of water is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>100</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> at 1.00 atm. At higher pressure, the boiling point is higher, and at lower pressure, it is lower. The main exception is the melting and freezing of water, discussed in the next section.</para>

<title>Phase Diagrams</title>
<para id="fs-id1170902270285">The phase of a given substance depends on the pressure and temperature. Thus, plots of pressure versus temperature showing the phase in each region provide considerable insight into thermal properties of substances. Such a <emphasis effect="italics">pT</emphasis> graph is called a <term>phase diagram</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170904147061"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_18_05_PhaseDiag"/> shows the phase diagram for water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and temperature, you can determine the phase of water. The solid curves—boundaries between phases—indicate phase transitions, that is, temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist. For example, the boiling point of water is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>100</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> at 1.00 atm. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature rises gradually to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>374</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> at a pressure of 218 atm. A pressure cooker (or even a covered pot) cooks food faster than an open pot, because the water can exist as a liquid at temperatures greater than <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>100</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> without all boiling away. (As we’ll see in the next section, liquid water conducts heat better than steam or hot air.) The boiling point curve ends at a certain point called the <term>critical point</term>—that is, a <term>critical temperature</term>, above which the liquid and gas phases cannot be distinguished; the substance is called a <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">supercritical fluid</emphasis></term>. At sufficiently high pressure above the critical point, the gas has the density of a liquid but does not condense. Carbon dioxide, for example, is supercritical at all temperatures above <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>31.0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>. <term>Critical pressure</term> is the pressure of the critical point.</para>

<caption>The phase diagram (<emphasis effect="italics">pT</emphasis> graph) for water shows solid (s), liquid (l), and vapor (v) phases. At temperatures and pressure above those of the critical point, there is no distinction between liquid and vapor. Note that the axes are nonlinear and the graph is not to scale. This graph is simplified—it omits several exotic phases of ice at higher pressures. The phase diagram of water is unusual because the melting-point curve has a negative slope, showing that you can melt ice by <emphasis effect="italics">increasing</emphasis> the pressure.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1170902070361">Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_18_05_PhaseDiag"/> gives the melting temperature at various pressures. For example, the melting point is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext><m:mspace width="0.2em"/></m:mrow></m:math> at 1.00 atm, as expected. Water has the unusual property that ice is less dense than liquid water at the melting point, so at a fixed temperature, you can change the phase from solid (ice) to liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. That is, the melting temperature of ice falls with increased pressure, as the phase diagram shows. For example, when a car is driven over snow, the increased pressure from the tires melts the snowflakes; afterwards, the water refreezes and forms an ice layer.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170904055343">As you learned in the earlier section on thermometers and temperature scales, the <term class="no-emphasis">triple point</term> is the combination of temperature and pressure at which ice, liquid water, and water vapor can coexist stably—that is, all three phases exist in equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>273.16</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>K</m:mtext><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mn>0.01</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> and 611.2 Pa; that is a more accurate calibration temperature than the melting point of water at 1.00 atm, or <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>273.15</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>K</m:mtext><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mn>0.0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1170903721240">At pressures below that of the triple point, there is no liquid phase; the substance can exist as either gas or solid. For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called <term>sublimation</term>. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or that ice cubes can disappear in a freezer. Both are examples of sublimation. The reverse also happens: Frost can form on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_18_05_DryIce"/> shows the result, as well as showing a familiar example of sublimation. Carbon dioxide has no liquid phase at atmospheric pressure. Solid <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mrow><m:mtext>CO</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> is known as <term class="no-emphasis">dry ice</term> because instead of melting, it sublimes.

Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to spread a perfume around a room. Some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors.</para>

<title>Equilibrium</title>
<para id="fs-id1170903806764">At the melting temperature, the solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium. If heat is added, some of the solid will melt, and if heat is removed, some of the liquid will freeze. The situation is somewhat more complex for liquid-gas equilibrium. Generally, liquid and gas are in equilibrium at any temperature. We call the gas phase a <term>vapor</term> when it exists at a temperature below the boiling temperature, as it does for water at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>20.0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>. Liquid in a closed container at a fixed temperature evaporates until the pressure of the gas reaches a certain value, called the <term>vapor pressure</term>, which depends on the gas and the temperature. At this equilibrium, if heat is added, some of the liquid will evaporate, and if heat is removed, some of the gas will condense; molecules either join the liquid or form suspended droplets. If there is not enough liquid for the gas to reach the vapor pressure in the container, all the liquid eventually evaporates.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170903804877">If the vapor pressure of the liquid is greater than the <emphasis effect="italics">total</emphasis> ambient pressure, including that of any air (or other gas), the liquid evaporates rapidly; in other words, it boils. Thus, the boiling point of a liquid at a given pressure is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure. Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at the boiling temperature (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_18_05_Equilib"/>). If a substance is in a closed container at the boiling point, then the liquid is boiling and the gas is condensing at the same rate without net change in their amounts.</para>

<caption>Equilibrium between liquid and gas at two different boiling points inside a closed container. (a) The rates of boiling and condensation are equal at this combination of temperature and pressure, so the liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium. (b) At a higher temperature, the boiling rate is faster, that is, the rate at which molecules leave the liquid and enter the gas is faster. This increases the number of molecules in the gas, which increases the gas pressure, which in turn increases the rate at which gas molecules condense and enter the liquid. The pressure stops increasing when it reaches the point where the boiling rate and the condensation rate are equal. The gas and liquid are in equilibrium again at this higher temperature and pressure.</caption>

The gas surrounding an open pot is not pure water: it is mixed with air.

Another way to see this is that at the boiling point, the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure. However, part of the ambient pressure is due to air, so the pressure of the steam is less than the vapor pressure at that temperature, and evaporation continues. Incidentally, the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero, a fact that accounts for sublimation.</para>

<para id="fs-id1170903876342">Where does the heat added during melting or boiling go, considering that the temperature does not change until the transition is complete? Energy is required to melt a solid, because the attractive forces between the molecules in the solid must be broken apart, so that in the liquid, the molecules can move around at comparable kinetic energies; thus, there is no rise in temperature. Energy is needed to vaporize a liquid for similar reasons. Conversely, work is done by attractive forces when molecules are brought together during freezing and condensation. That energy must be transferred out of the system, usually in the form of heat, to allow the molecules to stay together (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_18_05_Energy"/>). Thus, condensation occurs in association with cold objects—the glass in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_18_05_Condens"/>, for example.</para>

</table>
<para id="fs-id1170902266855">Phase changes can have a strong stabilizing effect on temperatures that are not near the melting and boiling points, since evaporation and condensation occur even at temperatures below the boiling point. For example, air temperatures in humid climates rarely go above approximately <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>38.0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> because most heat transfer goes into evaporating water into the air. Similarly, temperatures in humid weather rarely fall below the dew point—the temperature where condensation occurs given the concentration of water vapor in the air—because so much heat is released when water vapor condenses.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170903803864">More energy is required to evaporate water below the boiling point than at the boiling point, because the kinetic energy of water molecules at temperatures below <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>100</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> is less than that at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>100</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>, so less energy is available from random thermal motions. For example, at body temperature, evaporation of sweat from the skin requires a heat input of 2428 kJ/kg, which is about 10% higher than the latent heat of vaporization at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>100</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>. This heat comes from the skin, and this evaporative cooling effect of sweating helps reduce the body temperature in hot weather. However, high humidity inhibits evaporation, so that body temperature might rise, while unevaporated sweat might be left on your brow.</para>

This example illustrates the large energies involved during a phase change. The mass of ice is about 7% of the mass of the soda but leads to a noticeable change in the temperature of the soda. Although we assumed that the ice was at the freezing temperature, this is unrealistic for ice straight out of a freezer: The typical temperature is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>−6</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>. However, this correction makes no significant change from the result we found. Can you explain why?</para>
</example>
<para id="fs-id1170904052286">Like solid-liquid and liquid-vapor transitions, direct solid-vapor transitions or sublimations involve heat.

<title>The Effects of Heat Transfer</title>
<list id="fs-id1170904111936" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When it is not obvious whether a phase change occurs or not, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on.</item>
<item>Identify and list all objects that change temperature or phase.</item>
<item>Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.</item>
<item>Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat of the substance (<link document="m58387">Heat Transfer, Specific Heat, and Calorimetry</link>), and if there is a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat of the substance (<link target-id="fs-id1170903879019"/>).</item>
<item>Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).</item>
<item>Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You may need to do this in steps if there is more than one state to the process, such as a temperature change followed by a phase change. However, in a calorimetry problem, each step corresponds to a term in the single equation <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>Q</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>hot</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:msub><m:mi>Q</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>cold</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math>.</item>
<item>Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that any temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.</item>
