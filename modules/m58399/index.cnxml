<para id="fs-id1172101688475">In solving mechanics problems, we isolate the body under consideration, analyze the external forces acting on it, and then use Newton’s laws to predict its behavior. In thermodynamics, we take a similar approach. We start by identifying the part of the universe we wish to study; it is also known as our system. (We defined a system at the beginning of this chapter as anything whose properties are of interest to us; it can be a single atom or the entire Earth.) Once our system is selected, we determine how the environment, or surroundings, interact with the system. Finally, with the interaction understood, we study the thermal behavior of the system with the help of the laws of thermodynamics.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099598613">The thermal behavior of a system is described in terms of <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">thermodynamic variables</emphasis></term>. For an ideal gas, these variables are pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of molecules or moles of the gas. Different types of systems are generally characterized by different sets of variables. For example, the thermodynamic variables for a stretched rubber band are tension, length, temperature, and mass.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099664609">The state of a system can change as a result of its interaction with the environment. The change in a system can be fast or slow and large or small. The manner in which a state of a system can change from an initial state to a final state is called a <term>thermodynamic process</term>. For analytical purposes in thermodynamics, it is helpful to divide up processes as either <emphasis effect="italics">quasi-static</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">non-quasi-static</emphasis>, as we now explain.</para>

<title>Quasi-static and Non-quasi-static Processes</title>
<para id="fs-id1172101769640">A <term class="no-emphasis">quasi-static process</term> refers to an idealized or imagined process where the change in state is made infinitesimally slowly so that at each instant, the system can be assumed to be at a thermodynamic equilibrium with itself and with the environment. For instance, imagine heating 1 kg of water from a temperature <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>20</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>21</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> at a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere. To heat the water very slowly, we may imagine placing the container with water in a large bath that can be slowly heated such that the temperature of the bath can rise infinitesimally slowly from <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>20</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>21</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>. If we put 1 kg of water at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>20</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> directly into a bath at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>21</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>, the temperature of the water will rise rapidly to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>21</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>°</m:mtext><m:mtext>C</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> in a non-quasi-static way.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099887618">Quasi-static processes are done slowly enough that the system remains at thermodynamic equilibrium at each instant, despite the fact that the system changes over time. The thermodynamic equilibrium of the system is necessary for the system to have well-defined values of macroscopic properties such as the temperature and the pressure of the system at each instant of the process. Therefore, quasi-static processes can be shown as well-defined paths in state space of the system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101895022">Since quasi-static processes cannot be completely realized for any finite change of the system, all processes in nature are non-quasi-static. Examples of quasi-static and <term class="no-emphasis">non-quasi-static processes</term> are shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_20_04_Quasi"/>. Despite the fact that all finite changes must occur essentially non-quasi-statically at some stage of the change, we can imagine performing infinitely many quasi-static process corresponding to every quasi-static process. Since quasi-static processes can be analyzed analytically, we mostly study quasi-static processes in this book.

<title>Isothermal Processes</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099483703">An <term>isothermal process</term> is a change in the state of the system at a constant temperature. This process is accomplished by keeping the system in thermal equilibrium with a large heat bath during the process. Recall that a heat bath is an idealized “infinitely” large system whose temperature does not change. In practice, the temperature of a finite bath is controlled by either adding or removing a finite amount of energy as the case may be.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101798310">As an illustration of an isothermal process, consider a cylinder of gas with a movable piston immersed in a large water tank whose temperature is maintained constant. Since the piston is freely movable, the pressure inside <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>P</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>in</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> is balanced by the pressure outside <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>P</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>out</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> by some weights on the piston, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_20_04_Piston"/>.</para>

Inside the heat bath is a smaller container filled with gas. The smaller gas container is capped by a piston that has weights on top of it. The inside of the smaller container is the system. A double headed arrow across the smaller container’s walls labeled “heat” indicates that heat can flow between the bath and the system. An upward arrow inside the system points up at the bottom of the piston and is labeled p in. A downward arrow outside the system points down at the top of the piston and is labeled p out. A second downward arrow points at the top of the piston where the weights are stacked.">

<caption>Expanding a system at a constant temperature. Removing weights on the piston leads to an imbalance of forces on the piston, which causes the piston to move up. As the piston moves up, the temperature is lowered momentarily, which causes heat to flow from the heat bath to the system. The energy to move the piston eventually comes from the heat bath.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1172099694219">As weights on the piston are removed, an imbalance of forces on the piston develops. The net nonzero force on the piston would cause the piston to accelerate, resulting in an increase in volume. The expansion of the gas cools the gas to a lower temperature, which makes it possible for the heat to enter from the heat bath into the system until the temperature of the gas is reset to the temperature of the heat bath. If weights are removed in infinitesimal steps, the pressure in the system decreases infinitesimally slowly. This way, an isothermal process can be conducted quasi-statically. An isothermal line on a (<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">V</emphasis>) diagram is represented by a curved line from starting point <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis> to finishing point <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis>, as seen in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_20_04_Isotherm"/>.

<para id="fs-id1172099598286">An isothermal process studied in this chapter is quasi-statically performed, since to be isothermal throughout the change of volume, you must be able to state the temperature of the system at each step, which is possible only if the system is in thermal equilibrium continuously. The system must go out of equilibrium for the state to change, but for quasi-static processes, we imagine that the process is conducted in infinitesimal steps such that these departures from equilibrium can be made as brief and as small as we like.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099650097">Other quasi-static processes of interest for gases are isobaric and isochoric processes.

<title>Adiabatic Processes</title>
<para id="fs-id1172097347677">In an <term>adiabatic process</term>, the system is insulated from its environment so that although the state of the system changes, no heat is allowed to enter or leave the system, as seen in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_20_04_Adiabat"/>. An adiabatic process can be conducted either quasi-statically or non-quasi-statically. When a system expands adiabatically, it must do work against the outside world, and therefore its energy goes down, which is reflected in the lowering of the temperature of the system. An adiabatic expansion leads to a lowering of temperature, and an adiabatic compression leads to an increase of temperature. We discuss adiabatic expansion again in <link document="m58401">Adiabatic Processes for an ideal Gas</link>.</para>

<caption>An insulated piston with a hot, compressed gas is released. The piston moves up, the volume expands, and the pressure and temperature decrease. The internal energy goes into work. If the expansion occurs within a time frame in which negligible heat can enter the system, then the process is called adiabatic. Ideally, during an adiabatic process no heat enters or exits the system.</caption>
