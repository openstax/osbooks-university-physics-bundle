<para id="fs-id1172098308027">We have just seen that some circuits may be analyzed by reducing a circuit to a single voltage source and an equivalent resistance. Many complex circuits cannot be analyzed with the series-parallel techniques developed in the preceding sections. In this section, we elaborate on the use of Kirchhoff’s rules to analyze more complex circuits. For example, the circuit in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_27_02_Circuit"/> is known as a <term class="no-emphasis">multi-loop circuit</term>, which consists of junctions. A junction, also known as a node, is a connection of three or more wires. In this circuit, the previous methods cannot be used, because not all the resistors are in clear series or parallel configurations that can be reduced. Give it a try. The resistors <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mn>1</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> and <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> are in series and can be reduced to an equivalent resistance. The same is true of resistors <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math> and <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mn>5</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math>. But what do you do then?</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098704408">Even though this circuit cannot be analyzed using the methods already learned, two circuit analysis rules can be used to analyze any circuit, simple or complex. The rules are known as <term>Kirchhoff’s rules</term>, after their inventor Gustav <term class="no-emphasis">Kirchhoff</term> (1824–1887).</para>

<title>Kirchhoff’s First Rule</title>
<para id="fs-id1172098686253">Kirchhoff’s first rule (the <term>junction rule</term>) applies to the charge entering and leaving a junction (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_27_02_Junction"/>). As stated earlier, a junction, or node, is a connection of three or more wires. Current is the flow of charge, and charge is conserved; thus, whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out.</para>

<title>Kirchhoff’s Second Rule</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100647402">Kirchhoff’s second rule (the <term>loop rule</term>) applies to potential differences. The loop rule is stated in terms of potential <emphasis effect="italics">V</emphasis> rather than potential energy, but the two are related since <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>U</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>q</m:mi><m:mi>V</m:mi><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> In a closed loop, whatever energy is supplied by a voltage source, the energy must be transferred into other forms by the devices in the loop, since there are no other ways in which energy can be transferred into or out of the circuit. Kirchhoff’s loop rule states that the algebraic sum of potential differences, including voltage supplied by the voltage sources and resistive elements, in any loop must be equal to zero. For example, consider a simple loop with no junctions, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_27_02_SimpleLoop"/>.</para>

Voltage increases as we cross the battery, whereas voltage decreases as we travel across a resistor. The <term class="no-emphasis">potential drop</term>, or change in the electric potential, is equal to the current through the resistor times the resistance of the resistor.

<para id="fs-id1172100910945">Another example dealing with multiple voltage sources is that of combinations of <term class="no-emphasis">solar cells</term>—wired in both series and parallel combinations to yield a desired voltage and current. Photovoltaic generation, which is the conversion of sunlight directly into electricity, is based upon the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is beyond the scope of this chapter and is covered in <link document="m58757">Photons and Matter Waves</link>, but in general, photons hitting the surface of a solar cell create an electric current in the cell.</para>

<item>Kirchhoff’s rules can be used to analyze any circuit, simple or complex. The simpler series and parallel connection rules are special cases of Kirchhoff’s rules.</item>
<item>Kirchhoff’s first rule, also known as the junction rule, applies to the charge to a junction. Current is the flow of charge; thus, whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out.</item>
<item>Kirchhoff’s second rule, also known as the loop rule, states that the voltage drop around a loop is zero.</item>
<item>When calculating potential and current using Kirchhoff’s rules, a set of conventions must be followed for determining the correct signs of various terms.</item>
<item>When multiple voltage sources are in series, their internal resistances add together and their emfs add together to get the total values.</item>
<item>When multiple voltage sources are in parallel, their internal resistances combine to an equivalent resistance that is less than the individual resistance and provides a higher current than a single cell.</item>
<item>Solar cells can be wired in series or parallel to provide increased voltage or current, respectively.</item>
