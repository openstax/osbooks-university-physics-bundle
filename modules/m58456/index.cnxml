<para id="fs-id1172099547884">Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s method are useful to analyze and design electrical circuits, providing you with the voltages across, the current through, and the resistance of the components that compose the circuit. To measure these parameters require instruments, and these instruments are described in this section.</para>

<title>Measuring Current with an Ammeter</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099614791">To measure the current through a device or component, the ammeter is placed in series with the device or component. A series connection is used because objects in series have the same current passing through them.

<caption>(a) When an ammeter is used to measure the current through two resistors connected in series to a battery, a single ammeter is placed in series with the two resistors because the current is the same through the two resistors in series. (b) When two resistors are connected in parallel with a battery, three meters, or three separate ammeter readings, are necessary to measure the current from the battery and through each resistor. The ammeter is connected in series with the component in question.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1172101887500">Ammeters need to have a very low resistance, a fraction of a milliohm. If the resistance is not negligible, placing the ammeter in the circuit would change the equivalent resistance of the circuit and modify the current that is being measured. Since the current in the circuit travels through the meter, ammeters normally contain a fuse to protect the meter from damage from currents which are too high.</para>

<title>Analog and Digital Meters</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099892685">You may encounter two types of meters in the physics lab: analog and digital. The term ‘analog’ refers to signals or information represented by a continuously variable physical quantity, such as voltage or current. An <term class="no-emphasis">analog meter</term> uses a galvanometer, which is essentially a coil of wire with a small resistance, in a magnetic field, with a pointer attached that points to a scale. Current flows through the coil, causing the coil to rotate. To use the galvanometer as an ammeter, a small resistance is placed in parallel with the coil. For a voltmeter, a large resistance is placed in series with the coil. A <term class="no-emphasis">digital meter</term> uses a component called an analog-to-digital (A to D) converter and expresses the current or voltage as a series of the digits 0 and 1, which are used to run a digital display. Most analog meters have been replaced by digital meters.</para>

<title>Ohmmeters</title>
<para id="fs-id1172099516329">An <term class="no-emphasis">ohmmeter</term> is an instrument used to measure the resistance of a component or device. The operation of the ohmmeter is based on Ohm’s law. Traditional ohmmeters contained an internal voltage source (such as a battery) that would be connected across the component to be tested, producing a current through the component. A galvanometer was then used to measure the current and the resistance was deduced using Ohm’s law. Modern digital meters use a constant current source to pass current through the component, and the voltage difference across the component is measured. In either case, the resistance is measured using Ohm’s law <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>V</m:mi><m:mtext>/</m:mtext><m:mi>I</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mo>,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> where the voltage is known and the current is measured, or the current is known and the voltage is measured.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099464263">The component of interest should be isolated from the circuit; otherwise, you will be measuring the equivalent resistance of the circuit. An ohmmeter should never be connected to a “live” circuit, one with a voltage source connected to it and current running through it. Doing so can damage the meter.</para>

<title>Summary</title>
<list id="fs-id1172099560046" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="bullet">
<item>Voltmeters measure voltage, and ammeters measure current. Analog meters are based on the combination of a resistor and a galvanometer, a device that gives an analog reading of current or voltage. Digital meters are based on analog-to-digital converters and provide a discrete or digital measurement of the current or voltage.</item>
<item>A voltmeter is placed in parallel with the voltage source to receive full voltage and must have a large resistance to limit its effect on the circuit.</item>
<item>An ammeter is placed in series to get the full current flowing through a branch and must have a small resistance to limit its effect on the circuit.</item>
<item>Standard voltmeters and ammeters alter the circuit they are connected to and are thus limited in accuracy.</item>
<item>Ohmmeters are used to measure resistance. The component in which the resistance is to be measured should be isolated (removed) from the circuit.</item>
