<para id="fs-id1172101747831">Most examples dealt with so far in this book, particularly those using batteries, have constant-voltage sources. Thus, once the current is established, it is constant. <term>Direct current (dc)</term> is the flow of electric charge in only one direction. It is the steady state of a constant-voltage circuit.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101904658">Most well-known applications, however, use a time-varying voltage source. <term>Alternating current (ac)</term> is the flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction. An ac is produced by an alternating emf, which is generated in a power plant, as described in <link document="m58479">Induced Electric Fields</link>. If the ac source varies periodically, particularly sinusoidally, the circuit is known as an ac circuit. Examples include the commercial and residential power that serves so many of our needs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101787952">The ac voltages and frequencies commonly used in businesses and homes vary around the world. In a typical house, the potential difference between the two sides of an electrical outlet alternates sinusoidally with a frequency of 60 or 50 Hz and an amplitude of 170 or 311 V, depending on whether you live in the United States or Europe, respectively. Most people know the potential difference for electrical outlets is 120 V or 220 V in the US or Europe, but as explained later in the chapter, these voltages are not the peak values given here but rather are related to the common voltages we see in our electrical outlets. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_32_01_DcAcPower"/> shows graphs of voltage and current versus time for typical dc and ac power in the United States.</para><figure id="CNX_UPhysics_32_01_DcAcPower"><media id="fs-id1172101783477" alt="Figures a and b show graphs of voltage and current versus time. Figure a shows direct voltage and direct current as horizontal lines on the graph, with positive y values. Current has a lower y-value than voltage. Figure b shows alternating voltage and alternating current as sinusoidal waves on the graph, with voltage having a greater amplitude than current. They have the same wavelength. Half-wavelength has an x-value of 8.33 and one wavelength has an x-value of 16.6. The maximum y-values of voltage and current are marked V0 and I0 respectively and the minimum y-values are marked minus V0 and minus I0 respectively.">

<caption>(a) The dc voltage and current are constant in time, once the current is established. (b) The voltage and current versus time are quite different for ac power. In this example, which shows 60-Hz ac power and time <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis> in milliseconds, voltage and current are sinusoidal and are in phase for a simple resistance circuit. The frequencies and peak voltages of ac sources differ greatly.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1172101910311">Suppose we hook up a resistor to an ac voltage source and determine how the voltage and current vary in time across the resistor. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_32_01_SimpleCir"/> shows a schematic of a simple circuit with an ac voltage source. The voltage fluctuates sinusoidally with time at a fixed frequency, as shown, on either the battery terminals or the resistor.
