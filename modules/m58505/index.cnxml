<para id="fs-id1172100586085">The speed of light in a vacuum <emphasis effect="italics">c</emphasis> is one of the fundamental constants of physics. As you will see when you reach <link document="m58555">Relativity</link>, it is a central concept in Einstein’s theory of relativity. As the accuracy of the measurements of the speed of light improved, it was found that different observers, even those moving at large velocities with respect to each other, measure the same value for the speed of light. However, the speed of light does vary in a precise manner with the material it traverses. These facts have far-reaching implications, as we will see in later chapters.</para>

<title>The Speed of Light: Early Measurements</title>
<para id="fs-id1172098581164">The first measurement of the speed of light was made by the Danish astronomer Ole <term class="no-emphasis">Roemer</term> (1644–1710) in 1675. He studied the orbit of Io, one of the four large moons of Jupiter, and found that it had a period of revolution of 42.5 h around Jupiter. He also discovered that this value fluctuated by a few seconds, depending on the position of Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Roemer realized that this fluctuation was due to the finite speed of light and could be used to determine <emphasis effect="italics">c</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100633748">Roemer found the period of revolution of Io by measuring the time interval between successive eclipses by Jupiter. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_01_RoemerMeth"/>(a) shows the planetary configurations when such a measurement is made from Earth in the part of its orbit where it is receding from Jupiter. When Earth is at point <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>, Earth, Jupiter, and Io are aligned. The next time this alignment occurs, Earth is at point <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis>, and the light carrying that information to Earth must travel to that point. Since <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis> is farther from Jupiter than <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>, light takes more time to reach Earth when Earth is at <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis>. Now imagine it is about 6 months later, and the planets are arranged as in part (b) of the figure. The measurement of Io’s period begins with Earth at point <m:math><m:mi>A</m:mi><m:mtext>′</m:mtext></m:math> and Io eclipsed by Jupiter. The next eclipse then occurs when Earth is at point <m:math><m:mi>B</m:mi><m:mtext>′</m:mtext></m:math>, to which the light carrying the information of this eclipse must travel. Since <m:math><m:mi>B</m:mi><m:mtext>′</m:mtext></m:math> is closer to Jupiter than <m:math><m:mi>A</m:mi><m:mtext>′</m:mtext></m:math>, light takes less time to reach Earth when it is at <m:math><m:mi>B</m:mi><m:mtext>′</m:mtext></m:math>.

By measuring the difference in these time intervals and with appropriate knowledge of the distance between Jupiter and Earth, Roemer calculated that the speed of light was <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>2.0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mn>8</m:mn></m:msup><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>m/s</m:mtext><m:mo>,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> which is 33% below the value accepted today.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098449740">The first successful terrestrial measurement of the speed of light was made by Armand <term class="no-emphasis">Fizeau</term> (1819–1896) in 1849. He placed a toothed wheel that could be rotated very rapidly on one hilltop and a mirror on a second hilltop 8 km away (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_01_FizeauMeth"/>). An intense light source was placed behind the wheel, so that when the wheel rotated, it chopped the light beam into a succession of pulses. The speed of the wheel was then adjusted until no light returned to the observer located behind the wheel. This could only happen if the wheel rotated through an angle corresponding to a displacement of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mi>n</m:mi><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mn>½</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> teeth, while the pulses traveled down to the mirror and back.

It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Or light can travel through various media, such as air and glass, to the observer. Light can also arrive after being reflected, such as by a mirror.

(b) Light can reach a person by traveling through media like air and glass. (c) Light can also reflect from an object like a mirror.

<para id="fs-id1172098313544">Experiments show that when light interacts with an object several times larger than its wavelength, it travels in straight lines and acts like a ray. Its wave characteristics are not pronounced in such situations. Since the wavelength of visible light is less than a micron (a thousandth of a millimeter), it acts like a ray in the many common situations in which it encounters objects larger than a micron. For example, when visible light encounters anything large enough that we can observe it with unaided eyes, such as a coin, it acts like a ray, with generally negligible wave characteristics.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098390480">In all of these cases, we can model the path of light as straight lines. Light may change direction when it encounters objects (such as a mirror) or in passing from one material to another (such as in passing from air to glass), but it then continues in a straight line or as a ray. The word “ray” comes from mathematics and here means a straight line that originates at some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays. The <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">ray model of light</emphasis></term> describes the path of light as straight lines.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098382388">Since light moves in straight lines, changing directions when it interacts with materials, its path is described by geometry and simple trigonometry. This part of optics, where the ray aspect of light dominates, is therefore called <term>geometric optics</term>. Two laws govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter. These are the <emphasis effect="italics">law of reflection</emphasis>, for situations in which light bounces off matter, and the <emphasis effect="italics">law of refraction</emphasis>, for situations in which light passes through matter. We will examine more about each of these laws in upcoming sections of this chapter.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098309950">This fact simply proves that the speed of light is greater than that of sound. If one knows the distance to the location of the lightning and the speed of sound, one could, in principle, determine the speed of light from the data. In practice, because the speed of light is so great, the data would have to be known to impractically high precision.</para>
