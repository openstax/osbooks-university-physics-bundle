<para id="fs-id1172099730393">Everyone enjoys the spectacle of a rainbow glimmering against a dark stormy sky. How does sunlight falling on clear drops of rain get broken into the rainbow of colors we see? It is the same process that causes white light to be broken into colors by a clear glass prism or a diamond (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_05_Rainbow"/>), and it was examined in detail by Kamal al-Din Hasan ibn Ali ibn Hasan al-Farisi. Working in his native Persia (now Iran), Farisi designed a series of innovative experiments to understand light and clarify the work of earlier scientists. At that time, there were no microscopes to examine tiny drops of water similar to those in the atmosphere, so Farisi created an enormous drop of water. He filled a large glass vessel with water and placed it inside a camera obscura, in which he could carefully control the entry of light. Based on the resulting multicolored spectra of light, he deduced that water droplets split — or decompose — white light into the colors of the rainbow. Farisi's contemporary, Theodoric of Freiberg (in Germany), performed similar experiments using other equipment.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172099696137">We see about six colors in a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">rainbow</term>—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet; sometimes indigo is listed, too. These colors are associated with different wavelengths of light, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_05_Rainbow2"/>. When our eye receives pure-wavelength light, we tend to see only one of the six colors, depending on wavelength. The thousands of other hues we can sense in other situations are our eye’s response to various mixtures of wavelengths. White light, in particular, is a fairly uniform mixture of all visible wavelengths. Sunlight, considered to be white, actually appears to be a bit yellow, because of its mixture of wavelengths, but it does contain all visible wavelengths. The sequence of colors in rainbows is the same sequence as the colors shown in the figure. This implies that white light is spread out in a rainbow according to wavelength. <emphasis effect="bold">Dispersion</emphasis> is defined as the spreading of white light into its full spectrum of wavelengths. More technically, dispersion occurs whenever the propagation of light depends on wavelength.</para>

<media id="fs-id1172102062649" alt="The figure shows colors that are associated with different wavelengths of light in order of decreasing wavelength, lambda, measured in nanometers. Infrared starts at 800 nanometers. It is followed by visible light, which is a continuous distribution of colors with red at 700 nanometers, orange, yellow at 600 nanometers, green, blue at 500 nanometers, and violet at 400 nanometers. The distribution ends with ultraviolet which extends past the visible to about 300 nanometers.">

<caption>Even though rainbows are associated with six colors, the rainbow is a continuous distribution of colors according to wavelengths.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1172099512834">Any type of wave can exhibit dispersion. For example, sound waves, all types of electromagnetic waves, and water waves can be dispersed according to wavelength. Dispersion may require special circumstances and can result in spectacular displays such as in the production of a rainbow. This is also true for sound, since all frequencies ordinarily travel at the same speed. If you listen to sound through a long tube, such as a vacuum cleaner hose, you can easily hear it dispersed by interaction with the tube. Dispersion, in fact, can reveal a great deal about what the wave has encountered that disperses its wavelengths. The dispersion of electromagnetic radiation from outer space, for example, has revealed much about what exists between the stars—the so-called interstellar medium.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172101748204">Refraction is responsible for dispersion in rainbows and many other situations. The angle of refraction depends on the index of refraction, as we know from Snell’s law. We know that the index of refraction <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> depends on the medium. But for a given medium, <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> also depends on wavelength (<link target-id="fs-id1172102138232"/>). Note that for a given medium, <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> increases as wavelength decreases and is greatest for violet light. Thus, violet light is bent more than red light, as shown for a prism in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_05_Prisms"/>(b).

<media id="fs-id1172099494812" alt="Figure a shows a drawing of a triangle glass prism and a pure wavelength lambda of incident light falling onto it and getting refracted at both sides of the prism. The incident ray hits the bends going into the prism. The refracted ray runs parallel to the base of the prism and then emerges after getting refracted at the other surface. Because the normal to the two surfaces where refraction occurs are at an angle to each other, the net effect is that each refraction bends the ray further away from its original direction. Figure b shows the same triangle prism and an incident white light falling onto it. Two refracted rays are shown at the first surface with slightly different angles of separation. The refracted rays, on falling on the second surface, refract with various angles of refraction. A sequence of red at 760 nanometers to violet is at 380 nanometers produced when light emerges out of the prism.">

<para id="fs-id1172101787026">Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a rainbow only when you look away from the Sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_05_WaterDrop"/>). The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Since the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength, the light is dispersed, and a rainbow is observed (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_05_DiffColors"/>(a)). (No dispersion occurs at the back surface, because the law of reflection does not depend on wavelength.) The actual rainbow of colors seen by an observer depends on the myriad rays being refracted and reflected toward the observer’s eyes from numerous drops of water. The effect is most spectacular when the background is dark, as in stormy weather, but can also be observed in waterfalls and lawn sprinklers. The arc of a rainbow comes from the need to be looking at a specific angle relative to the direction of the Sun, as illustrated in part (b). If two reflections of light occur within the water drop, another “secondary” rainbow is produced. This rare event produces an arc that lies above the primary rainbow arc, as in part (c), and produces colors in the reverse order of the primary rainbow, with red at the lowest angle and violet at the largest angle.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172101672421">Dispersion may produce beautiful rainbows, but it can cause problems in optical systems. White light used to transmit messages in a fiber is dispersed, spreading out in time and eventually overlapping with other messages. Since a laser produces a nearly pure wavelength, its light experiences little dispersion, an advantage over white light for transmission of information. In contrast, dispersion of electromagnetic waves coming to us from outer space can be used to determine the amount of matter they pass through.</para>
