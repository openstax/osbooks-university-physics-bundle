<para id="fs-id1172101037573">So far in this chapter, we have been discussing optical phenomena using the ray model of light. However, some phenomena require analysis and explanations based on the wave characteristics of light. This is particularly true when the wavelength is not negligible compared to the dimensions of an optical device, such as a slit in the case of <emphasis effect="italics">diffraction</emphasis>. Huygens’s principle is an indispensable tool for this analysis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100799924"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Wave"/> shows how a transverse wave looks as viewed from above and from the side. A light wave can be imagined to propagate like this, although we do not actually see it wiggling through space. From above, we view the wave fronts (or wave crests) as if we were looking down on ocean waves. The side view would be a graph of the electric or magnetic field. The view from above is perhaps more useful in developing concepts about <term>wave optics</term>.</para>

The wave is propagating to the right, and appears as a series of vertical strips that gradually alternate from dark to light and repeat. The next view is a view from the side. The wave again propagates to the right and appears as a sine curve oscillating above and below a black arrow pointing to the right that serves as the horizontal axis. The third is an overall view. This is a perspective view of a wave of the same wavelength as in the first two images and looks like an undulating surface..">

<para id="fs-id1172100525973">The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves propagate. Starting from some known position, <term>Huygens’s principle</term> states that every point on a wave front is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wave front is tangent to all of the wavelets.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098457484"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Lines"/> shows how Huygens’s principle is applied. A wave front is the long edge that moves, for example, with the crest or the trough. Each point on the wave front emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed <emphasis effect="italics">v</emphasis>. We can draw these wavelets at a time <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis> later, so that they have moved a distance <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>s</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mi>t</m:mi><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> The new wave front is a plane tangent to the wavelets and is where we would expect the wave to be a time <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis> later. Huygens’s principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It is useful not only in describing how light waves propagate but also in explaining the laws of reflection and refraction. In addition, we will see that Huygens’s principle tells us how and where light rays interfere.</para>

As the wave front strikes the mirror, wavelets are first emitted from the left part of the mirror and then from the right. The wavelets closer to the left have had time to travel farther, producing a wave front traveling in the direction shown.</para>

<title>Refraction</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100574975">The law of refraction can be explained by applying Huygens’s principle to a wave front passing from one medium to another (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Surface"/>). Each wavelet in the figure was emitted when the wave front crossed the interface between the media. Since the speed of light is smaller in the second medium, the waves do not travel as far in a given time, and the new wave front changes direction as shown. This explains why a ray changes direction to become closer to the perpendicular when light slows down. Snell’s law can be derived from the geometry in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Surface"/> (<link target-id="fs-id1172100635976"/>).</para>

The refracted ray bends down, toward this dotted line where it enters medium two. The path of the ray makes an angle theta sub one with the dotted line in medium one and an angle theta sub two with the dotted line in medium two, where theta sub two is less than theta sub one. Line segments, labeled wave front, are drawn perpendicular to the incident ray and the refracted ray. These line segments are equally spaced within each medium, but the three line segments in medium 1 are more widely spaced than the three line segments in medium 2.

It hits the surface at point A and refracts toward the normal in medium 2.  A line, labeled incident wave front, is drawn from point A extending away from the surface, perpendicular to the incident ray. The angle between the incident wave front and the surface is theta 1.

The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a wave characteristic and occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for some phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is a wave. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through the slits in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Opening"/> is evidence that light is a wave.

<caption>Huygens’s principle applied to a plane wave front striking an opening. The edges of the wave front bend after passing through the opening, a process called diffraction. The amount of bending is more extreme for a small opening, consistent with the fact that wave characteristics are most noticeable for interactions with objects about the same size as the wavelength.</caption></figure></section>

<item>According to Huygens’s principle, every point on a wave front is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wave front is tangent to all of the wavelets.</item>
<item>A mirror reflects an incoming wave at an angle equal to the incident angle, verifying the law of reflection.</item>
<item>The law of refraction can be explained by applying Huygens’s principle to a wave front passing from one medium to another.</item>
<item>The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction.</item>
