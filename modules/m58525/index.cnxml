<para id="fs-id1172100629808">Polarizing sunglasses are familiar to most of us. They have a special ability to cut the glare of light reflected from water or glass (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_River"/>). They have this ability because of a wave characteristic of light called polarization. What is polarization? How is it produced? What are some of its uses? The answers to these questions are related to the wave character of light.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098373712">Light is one type of electromagnetic (EM) wave. As noted in the previous chapter on <link document="m58495">Electromagnetic Waves</link>, EM waves are <emphasis effect="italics">transverse waves</emphasis> consisting of varying electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_EMWave"/>). However, in general, there are no specific directions for the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields; they vibrate in any randomly oriented plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation. <emphasis effect="bold">Polarization</emphasis> is the attribute that a wave’s oscillations do have a definite direction relative to the direction of propagation of the wave. (This is not the same type of polarization as that discussed for the separation of charges.) Waves having such a direction are said to be <term>polarized</term>. For an EM wave, we define the <term>direction of polarization</term> to be the direction parallel to the electric field. Thus, we can think of the electric field arrows as showing the direction of polarization, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_EMWave"/>.</para><figure id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_EMWave">

Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are <term>horizontally polarized</term>. If a vertical slit is placed on the first rope, the waves pass through.

Such light is said to be <term>unpolarized</term>, because it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarization. Polaroid materials—which were invented by the founder of the Polaroid Corporation, Edwin Land—act as a polarizing slit for light, allowing only polarization in one direction to pass through. Polarizing filters are composed of long molecules aligned in one direction. If we think of the molecules as many slits, analogous to those for the oscillating ropes, we can understand why only light with a specific polarization can get through. The axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the electric field of an EM wave.</para>

The first filter polarizes the light along its axis.

In figure a, all of the polarized light is passed by the second polarizing filter,  whose axis is parallel to the first, and is still vertically polarized. In figure b, only some of the light is passed by the second polarizing filter,  whose axis is tilted relative to the first. The light that passed the second filter is polarized in the direction of the second filter’s axis, and the magnitude of E is reduced. In figure c, where the filter axes are perpendicular to each other, none of the light passes through the second filter. Figure c shows a photo of three circular optical filters placed over a bright colorful pattern. Two of these filters are place next to each other and the third is placed on top of the other two so that the center of the third is at the point where the edges of the two filters underneath touch.

<title>Polarization by Reflection</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100528765">By now, you can probably guess that polarizing sunglasses cut the glare in reflected light, because that light is polarized. You can check this for yourself by holding polarizing sunglasses in front of you and rotating them while looking at light reflected from water or glass. As you rotate the sunglasses, you will notice the light gets bright and dim, but not completely black. This implies the reflected light is partially polarized and cannot be completely blocked by a polarizing filter.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172100781361"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_PolByRef"/> illustrates what happens when unpolarized light is reflected from a surface. Vertically polarized light is preferentially refracted at the surface, so the reflected light is left more horizontally polarized. The reasons for this phenomenon are beyond the scope of this text, but a convenient mnemonic for remembering this is to imagine the polarization direction to be like an arrow. Vertical polarization is like an arrow perpendicular to the surface and is more likely to stick and not be reflected. Horizontal polarization is like an arrow bouncing on its side and is more likely to be reflected. Sunglasses with vertical axes thus block more reflected light than unpolarized light from other sources.</para>
<figure id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_PolByRef">
<media id="fs-id1172100967416" alt="The figure is a diagram that shows a block of glass in air.  The reflecting surface is horizontal. A ray labeled unpolarized light starts at the upper left and hits the center of the block, at an angle theta one to the vertical. Centered on this incident ray is are two double headed arrows, one horizontal and the other vertical. From the point where this ray hits the glass block, two rays emerge. One is the reflected ray that goes up and to the right at an angle of theta one to the vertical, and the second is a refracted ray that goes down and to the right at an angle of theta two to the vertical. The reflected light is labeled as partially polarized parallel to the surface. Two double headed arrows, similar to those on the incident ray, are shown centered on the reflected ray, but the vertical arrow is significantly shorter than the horizontal one. The refracted ray is labeled as partially polarized perpendicular to the surface. Two double headed arrows, similar to those on the incident ray, are shown centered on the reflected ray, but the horizontal arrow is significantly shorter than the vertical one. A note indicates that when theta one equals Brewster’s angle, the angle between the reflected and refracted ray is ninety degrees.">

<caption>Polarization by reflection. Unpolarized light has equal amounts of vertical and horizontal polarization. After interaction with a surface, the vertical components are preferentially absorbed or refracted, leaving the reflected light more horizontally polarized. This is akin to arrows striking on their sides and bouncing off, whereas arrows striking on their tips go into the surface.</caption>

Light reflected at these angles could be completely blocked by a good polarizing filter held with its axis vertical. Brewster’s angle for water and air are similar to those for glass and air, so that sunglasses are equally effective for light reflected from either water or glass under similar circumstances. Light that is not reflected is refracted into these media. Therefore, at an incident angle equal to Brewster’s angle, the refracted light is slightly polarized vertically. It is not completely polarized vertically, because only a small fraction of the incident light is reflected, so a significant amount of horizontally polarized light is refracted.</para>

<title>Atomic Explanation of Polarizing Filters</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100536282">Polarizing filters have a polarization axis that acts as a slit. This slit passes EM waves (often visible light) that have an electric field parallel to the axis. This is accomplished with long molecules aligned perpendicular to the axis, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_LongMol"/>.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1172100611110"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_ElectrMol"/> illustrates how the component of the electric field parallel to the long molecules is absorbed. An EM wave is composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The electric field is strong compared with the magnetic field and is more effective in exerting force on charges in the molecules. The most affected charged particles are the electrons, since electron masses are small. If an electron is forced to oscillate, it can absorb energy from the EM wave. This reduces the field in the wave and, hence, reduces its intensity. In long molecules, electrons can more easily oscillate parallel to the molecule than in the perpendicular direction. The electrons are bound to the molecule and are more restricted in their movement perpendicular to the molecule. Thus, the electrons can absorb EM waves that have a component of their electric field parallel to the molecule. The electrons are much less responsive to electric fields perpendicular to the molecule and allow these fields to pass. Thus, the axis of the polarizing filter is perpendicular to the length of the molecule.</para>

<title>Polarization by Scattering</title>
<para id="fs-id1172100510937">If you hold your polarizing sunglasses in front of you and rotate them while looking at blue sky, you will see the sky get bright and dim. This is a clear indication that light scattered by air is partially polarized. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_Scattering"/> helps illustrate how this happens. Since light is a transverse EM wave, it vibrates the electrons of air molecules perpendicular to the direction that it is traveling. The electrons then radiate like small antennae. Since they are oscillating perpendicular to the direction of the light ray, they produce EM radiation that is polarized perpendicular to the direction of the ray. When viewing the light along a line perpendicular to the original ray, as in the figure, there can be no polarization in the scattered light parallel to the original ray, because that would require the original ray to be a longitudinal wave. Along other directions, a component of the other polarization can be projected along the line of sight, and the scattered light is only partially polarized. Furthermore, multiple scattering can bring light to your eyes from other directions and can contain different polarizations.</para>

<media id="fs-id1172101028759" alt="The figure illustrates the scattering of unpolarized light by a molecule. As usual, the rays are represented by straight blue arrows and the electric field directions by double headed red arrows. The unpolarized incident light has electric field vectors oscillating in all directions in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the light rays. The molecule scatters the light in all directions. Light that is scattered in the same direction as the incident light remains unpolarized. Light scattered in the direction perpendicular to the direction as the incident light is polarized perpendicular to the plane defined by the incident and the scattered rays. Light that is scattered in an intermediate direction is partially polarized. The electric field perpendicular to the plane has a larger amplitude than the field parallel to the incident ray.">

Scattering from other particles, such as smoke or dust, can also polarize light. Detecting polarization in scattered EM waves can be a useful analytical tool in determining the scattering source.</para>

Besides being polarizing, sunglasses may have colored pigments embedded in them, whereas others use either a nonreflective or reflective coating.

Photochromic lenses are embedded with organic microcrystalline molecules that change their properties when exposed to UV in sunlight, but become clear in artificial lighting with no UV.</para>

<title>Liquid Crystals and Other Polarization Effects in Materials</title>

Liquid crystals are so named because their molecules can be aligned even though they are in a liquid. Liquid crystals have the property that they can rotate the polarization of light passing through them by <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>90</m:mn><m:mtext>°</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>. Furthermore, this property can be turned off by the application of a voltage, as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_Laptop"/>. It is possible to manipulate this characteristic quickly and in small, well-defined regions to create the contrast patterns we see in so many LCD devices.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172098524793">In flat screen LCD televisions, a large light is generated at the back of the TV. The light travels to the front screen through millions of tiny units called pixels (picture elements). One of these is shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_Laptop"/>(a) and (b). Each unit has three cells, with red, blue, or green filters, each controlled independently. When the voltage across a liquid crystal is switched off, the liquid crystal passes the light through the particular filter. We can vary the picture contrast by varying the strength of the voltage applied to the liquid crystal.</para>

Figure b is the same except that the L C D element is labeled voltage on, no rotation. The light coming out of the L C D element is thus vertically polarized and does not pass through the horizontal polarizer, making the region at this location dark.

Such substances are said to be <term>optically active</term>. Examples include sugar water, insulin, and collagen (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_OptAvail"/>). In addition to depending on the type of substance, the amount and direction of rotation depend on several other factors. Among these is the concentration of the substance, the distance the light travels through it, and the wavelength of light. Optical activity is due to the asymmetrical shape of molecules in the substance, such as being helical. Measurements of the rotation of polarized light passing through substances can thus be used to measure concentrations, a standard technique for sugars. It can also give information on the shapes of molecules, such as proteins, and factors that affect their shapes, such as temperature and pH.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098486449">Another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an unpolarized beam of light into two polarized beams. This occurs because the crystal has one value for the index of refraction of polarized light but a different value for the index of refraction of light polarized in the perpendicular direction, so that each component has its own angle of refraction. Such crystals are said to be <term>birefringent</term>, and, when aligned properly, two perpendicularly polarized beams will emerge from the crystal (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_07_Birefringe"/>). Birefringent crystals can be used to produce polarized beams from unpolarized light. Some birefringent materials preferentially absorb one of the polarizations. These materials are called dichroic and can produce polarization by this preferential absorption. This is fundamentally how polarizing filters and other polarizers work.</para>

The ray arrives at the interface between n 2 and n 3 at an angle of theta 2 to a perpendicular drawn at the point of incidence at this interface, and the transmitted ray bends away from the perpendicular, making an angle of theta three to the perpendicular on the n 3 side.

<para id="fs-id1172098560094">Consider sunlight entering Earth’s atmosphere at sunrise and sunset—that is, at a <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>90.0</m:mn><m:mtext>°</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> incident angle. Taking the boundary between nearly empty space and the atmosphere to be sudden, calculate the angle of refraction for sunlight. This lengthens the time the Sun appears to be above the horizon, both at sunrise and sunset. Now construct a problem in which you determine the angle of refraction for different models of the atmosphere, such as various layers of varying density. Your instructor may wish to guide you on the level of complexity to consider and on how the index of refraction varies with air density.</para>
