<para id="fs-id1172102062471">Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles, interfering constructively and destructively. This can be used as a spectroscopic tool—a diffraction grating disperses light according to wavelength, for example, and is used to produce spectra—but diffraction also limits the detail we can obtain in images.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101665463"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Light"/>(a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular <term class="no-emphasis">aperture</term>. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, we obtain a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light. This pattern is caused by diffraction, similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures as well.</para>

The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is still possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Light"/>(c), we cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail or <term>resolution</term> we can obtain. This limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101688448">Diffraction limits the resolution in many situations. The acuity of our vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, which is the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus, light passing through a lens with a diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> shows this effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> does. Thus, diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> of the primary mirror.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101945964">Just what is the limit? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (similar to a slit) (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Bulb"/>(a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis>, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>θ</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>1.22</m:mn><m:mtext>λ</m:mtext><m:mtext>/</m:mtext><m:mi>D</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> (providing the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments). The accepted criterion for determining the <term>diffraction limit</term> to resolution based on this angle is known as the <term>Rayleigh criterion</term>, which was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the nineteenth century.</para>

The angle found in part (a) is extraordinarily small (less than 1/50,000 of a degree), because the primary mirror is so large compared with the wavelength of light. As noticed, diffraction effects are most noticeable when light interacts with objects having sizes on the order of the wavelength of light. However, the effect is still there, and there is a diffraction limit to what is observable. The actual resolution of the Hubble Telescope is not quite as good as that found here. As with all instruments, there are other effects, such as nonuniformities in mirrors or aberrations in lenses that further limit resolution. However, <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Galaxy"/> gives an indication of the extent of the detail observable with the Hubble because of its size and quality, and especially because it is above Earth’s atmosphere.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172102067565">In a different type of microscope, molecules within a specimen are made to emit light through a mechanism called fluorescence. By controlling the molecules emitting light, it has become possible to construct images with resolution much finer than the Rayleigh criterion, thus circumventing the diffraction limit. The development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy led to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</para>
