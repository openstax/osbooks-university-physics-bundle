<para id="fs-id1167793266056">The analysis of simultaneity shows that Einstein’s postulates imply an important effect: Time intervals have different values when measured in different inertial frames. Suppose, for example, an astronaut measures the time it takes for a pulse of light to travel a distance perpendicular to the direction of his ship’s motion (relative to an earthbound observer), bounce off a mirror, and return (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_38_03_LightClock"/>). How does the elapsed time that the astronaut measures in the spacecraft compare with the elapsed time that an earthbound observer measures by observing what is happening in the spacecraft?</para>
<para id="fs-id1167794147339">Examining this question leads to a profound result. The elapsed time for a process depends on which observer is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut (within the spaceship where the astronaut is at rest) is smaller than the time measured by the earthbound observer (to whom the astronaut is moving). The time elapsed for the same process is different for the observers, because the distance the light pulse travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the earthbound frame, as seen in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_38_03_LightClock"/>. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, so it takes more time to travel the greater distance in the earthbound frame.</para>

<media id="fs-id1167794327413" alt="Figure a shows an illustration of an astronaut in the space shuttle observing an analog clock with an elapsed time Delta tau. The details of the clock experiment are also shown as follows: There is a light source, a receiver a short distance to its right, and a mirror centered above them. The vertical distance from the receiver and light source to the mirror is labeled as D. The path of the light from the source, up to the mirror, and back down to the receiver is shown. Figure b shows an observer on earth with an analog clock showing a time interval Delta t. Above the observer are three diagrams showing the clock experiment on the space shuttle at three different times and the path of the light. The light source in the diagram on the left is labeled “beginning event.” The receiver in the diagram on the right is labeled “ending event.” The path of the light forms a straight line going diagonally up and to the right, from the source in the diagram on the left to the mirror in the center diagram, and then another straight line going diagonally down and to the right, from the mirror in the center diagram to the receiver in the diagram on the right. The vertical distance from the receiver to the mirror is labeled D. The horizontal distance from the beginning event to the clock location in the center diagram is labeled L= v Delta t over 2. The horizontal distance from the clock location in the center diagram to the ending event is labeled L. Figure c shows an isosceles triangle with a horizontal base. The triangle is divided by a vertical line from its apex to its base into two identical right triangles with the vertical line forming a side that is shared by the two right triangles. This side is labeled D. The base of the triangle on the left is labeled L= v Delta t over 2. The base of the triangle on the right is labeled L. The hypotenuse of each of the right triangles is labeled s. Above the diagram is the equation s equals the square root of the quantity D squared plus L squared.">

<para id="fs-id1167793499880">Note the asymmetry between the two measurements. Only one of them is a measurement of the time interval between two events—the emission and arrival of the light pulse—at the same position. It is a measurement of the time interval in the rest frame of a single clock. The measurement in the earthbound frame involves comparing the time interval between two events that occur at different locations. The time interval between events that occur at a single location has a separate name to distinguish it from the time measured by the earthbound observer, and we use the separate symbol <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>τ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> to refer to it throughout this chapter.</para>

First, as stated earlier, elapsed time is not the same for different observers moving relative to one another, even though both are in inertial frames. A proper time interval <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>τ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> for an observer who, like the astronaut, is moving with the apparatus, is smaller than the time interval for other observers. It is the smallest possible measured time between two events. The earthbound observer sees time intervals within the moving system as dilated (i.e., lengthened) relative to how the observer moving relative to Earth sees them within the moving system. Alternatively, according to the earthbound observer, less time passes between events within the moving frame. Note that the shortest elapsed time between events is in the inertial frame in which the observer sees the events (e.g., the emission and arrival of the light signal) occur at the same point.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167794050382">This time effect is real and is not caused by inaccurate clocks or improper measurements. Time-interval measurements of the same event differ for observers in relative motion. The dilation of time is an intrinsic property of time itself. All clocks moving relative to an observer, including biological clocks, such as a person’s heartbeat, or aging, are observed to run more slowly compared with a clock that is stationary relative to the observer.</para>

<title>Half-Life of a Muon</title>
<para id="fs-id1167794172977">There is considerable experimental evidence that the equation <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>t</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>γ</m:mi><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>τ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> is correct. One example is found in cosmic ray particles that continuously rain down on Earth from deep space. Some collisions of these particles with nuclei in the upper atmosphere result in short-lived particles called <term class="no-emphasis">muons</term>. The half-life (amount of time for half of a material to decay) of a muon is 1.52 μs when it is at rest relative to the observer who measures the half-life. This is the proper time interval <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>τ</m:mi><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> This short time allows very few muons to reach Earth’s surface and be detected if Newtonian assumptions about time and space were correct. However, muons produced by cosmic ray particles have a range of velocities, with some moving near the speed of light. It has been found that the muon’s half-life as measured by an earthbound observer (<m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>t</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math>) varies with velocity exactly as predicted by the equation <m:math><m:mrow><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>t</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>γ</m:mi><m:mtext>Δ</m:mtext><m:mi>τ</m:mi><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> The faster the muon moves, the longer it lives. We on Earth see the muon last much longer than its half-life predicts within its own rest frame. As viewed from our frame, the muon decays more slowly than it does when at rest relative to us. A far larger fraction of muons reach the ground as a result.</para>

The time of travel is shorter in the electron frame of reference. Because the problem requires finding the time interval measured in different reference frames for the same process, relativity is involved. If we had tried to calculate the time in the electron rest frame by simply dividing the 0.200 m by the speed, the result would be slightly incorrect because of the relativistic speed of the electron.</para>

<title>The Twin Paradox</title>
<para id="fs-id1167794046972">An intriguing consequence of time dilation is that a space traveler moving at a high velocity relative to Earth would age less than the astronaut’s earthbound twin. This is often known as the <term class="no-emphasis">twin paradox</term>. Imagine the astronaut moving at such a velocity that <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>30.0</m:mn><m:mo>,</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_38_03_TwinPdox"/>. A trip that takes 2.00 years in her frame would take 60.0 years in the earthbound twin’s frame. Suppose the astronaut travels 1.00 year to another star system, briefly explores the area, and then travels 1.00 year back. An astronaut who was 40 years old at the start of the trip would be would be 42 when the spaceship returns. Everything on Earth, however, would have aged 60.0 years. The earthbound twin, if still alive, would be 100 years old.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167794065371">The situation would seem different to the astronaut in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_38_03_TwinPdox"/>. Because motion is relative, the spaceship would seem to be stationary and Earth would appear to move. (This is the sensation you have when flying in a jet.) Looking out the window of the spaceship, the astronaut would see time slow down on Earth by a factor of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>30.0</m:mn><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> Seen from the spaceship, the earthbound sibling will have aged only 2/30, or 0.07, of a year, whereas the astronaut would have aged 2.00 years.</para>
<figure id="CNX_UPhysics_38_03_TwinPdox">
<media id="fs-id1167793371941" alt="There are two illustrations. The first illustration is labeled “At the start of trip, both twins are the same age” and shows one of the twins on earth and the other on the ship travelling away from earth at relativistic speed. Both twins are the same age, and each has a clock. Both clocks show the same time. The second illustration is labeled “At end of trip, Earthbound twin has aged more than traveling twin.” This illustration shows the ship arriving back at earth. The twin on the ship looks about the same as in the first illustration and her clock shows a short elapsed time. The twin on the earth is very old, and her clock shows a long elapsed time.">

<caption>The twin paradox consists of the conflicting conclusions about which twin ages more as a result of a long space journey at relativistic speed.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167794050031">The paradox here is that the two twins cannot both be correct. As with all paradoxes, conflicting conclusions come from a false premise. In fact, the astronaut’s motion is significantly different from that of the earthbound twin. The astronaut accelerates to a high velocity and then accelerates opposite to the motion to view the star system. To return to Earth, she again accelerates and decelerates. The spacecraft is not in a single inertial frame to which the time dilation formula can be directly applied. That is, the astronaut twin changes inertial references. The earthbound twin does not experience these accelerations and remains in the same inertial frame. Thus, the situation is not symmetric, and it is incorrect to claim that the astronaut observes the same effects as her twin. The lack of symmetry between the twins will be still more evident when we analyze the journey later in this chapter in terms of the path the astronaut follows through four-dimensional space-time.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167793933475">In 1971, American physicists Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating verified time dilation at low relative velocities by flying extremely accurate atomic clocks around the world on commercial aircraft. They measured elapsed time to an accuracy of a few nanoseconds and compared it with the time measured by clocks left behind. Hafele and Keating’s results were within experimental uncertainties of the predictions of relativity. Both special and general relativity had to be taken into account, because gravity and accelerations were involved as well as relative motion.</para>
